Yes, that's a solid architecture following ERPNext patterns adapted for PocketBase! Here's the logical flow:

**DocTypes Structure:**
1. **Calendar Event** (parent)
2. **Calendar Event Notification** (child with relation to parent)

**Creation Flow:**
1. Create Calendar Event record
2. Auto-create related Calendar Event Notification records (1â†’2 relationship)
3. JS hook triggers on Calendar Event creation
4. Hook creates cron job(s) for each notification
5. Update flags: `scheduled: true`, `job_scheduled: true`

**Additional Architecture Considerations:**

**Flag Fields Needed:**
- `scheduled` (Boolean) - indicates notifications are queued
- `job_scheduled` (Boolean) - confirms cron jobs created
- `job_ids` (JSON/Text) - store cron job references for cleanup
- `notification_sent` (Boolean) - track delivery status per notification

**Hook Logic:**
- Parse notification records
- Calculate trigger times (event_time - minutes)
- Create individual cron jobs for each notification
- Handle timezone conversions
- Store job references for later cancellation/updates

**Edge Cases to Handle:**
- Event updates/deletions (cancel existing jobs, reschedule)
- Past notifications (skip or immediate send)
- Recurring events (multiple job sets)
- Job failure recovery

**PocketBase Benefits:**
- Real-time subscriptions for status updates
- Built-in authentication/authorization
- Simple REST API for external integrations
- Lightweight compared to ERPNext's complexity

This pattern maintains data integrity while providing flexible notification scheduling that can be monitored and managed effectively.

how cancellation of child notifictions on parent cancellation is done in ERPnext

Edit
In ERPNext, child document cancellation on parent cancellation is handled through several mechanisms:

1. Automatic Cascade via Framework:

ERPNext automatically handles child document lifecycle when docstatus changes
When parent is cancelled (docstatus = 2), framework automatically cancels all child documents
Child records inherit parent's docstatus state
2. on_cancel() Hook Implementation:

python
def on_cancel(self):
    # Cancel all child notifications
    for notification in self.notifications:
        notification.cancel()
    
    # Cancel any scheduled jobs
    self.cancel_scheduled_jobs()
3. Document Controller Methods:

cancel_linked_docs() - Framework method that handles related document cancellation
validate_cancellation() - Ensures cancellation is allowed based on business rules
Child documents have their own on_cancel() hooks for cleanup
4. Database-Level Constraints:

Child records have parenttype and parent fields linking them
Framework queries and updates all related children automatically
Maintains referential integrity
5. Scheduled Job Cleanup: ERPNext typically handles this through:

Custom fields storing job IDs/references
Background job cleanup in on_cancel()
Scheduler service integration (Redis Queue/Celery)
6. Status Propagation:

Parent cancellation triggers child status updates
Any external integrations (like cron jobs) are cleaned up
Audit trail maintained for all cancellations
For PocketBase Implementation: You'd need to manually implement this cascade logic in hooks since PocketBase doesn't have ERPNext's automatic child lifecycle management.

can you give me the document attributes propagation list (including status) from frappe and erpnext

Edit
I can provide the standard document attributes that typically propagate from parent to child documents in Frappe/ERPNext based on common patterns, though I should note that my knowledge has a cutoff and the exact implementation details may have evolved.

Core Frappe Framework Propagation:

Status/Workflow Fields:

docstatus (0=Draft, 1=Submitted, 2=Cancelled)
workflow_state (if workflow enabled)
Audit Fields:

owner (document creator)
creation (creation timestamp)
modified (last modification timestamp)
modified_by (last modifier)
Relationship Fields:

parent (parent document name)
parenttype (parent DocType)
parentfield (field name in parent)
Common Business Fields:

company (multi-company setups)
posting_date/transaction_date
fiscal_year
currency (in financial documents)
cost_center
project
ERPNext-Specific Propagation:

Financial Fields:

debit_to/credit_to
party_type/party
against_account
cost_center
project
budget
Manufacturing/Stock:

warehouse
batch_no
serial_no
item_group
HR/Payroll:

employee
department
branch
However, I'd recommend checking the current Frappe/ERPNext documentation or source code for the most up-to-date and complete list, as attribute propagation can be customized per DocType and may have additions I'm not aware of due to my knowledge cutoff.

Would you like me to search for more current information about this?
