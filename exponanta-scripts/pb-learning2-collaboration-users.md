Yes, your summary is mostly correct and aligns well with the best practice for PocketBase given its current limitations. Just a couple of clarifications and tweaks for clarity:

---

### Corrected summary of the **hybrid approach**:

```json
{
  "id": "record123",
  "owner": "user123",              // owner user ID (can be redundant with _createdBy)
  "user_ids": ["user456", "user789"],  // flat list of user IDs allowed access (for PB access rules)

  "data": {
    "users": [                    // detailed user objects with roles, for UI and app logic only
      { "id": "user456", "role": "editor" },
      { "id": "user789", "role": "viewer" }
    ],
    "code": "/* your code here */",
    "schema": { /* your schema here */ },
    "otherData": { /* ... */ }
  }
}
```

---

### Notes:

* Use **`user_ids`** (or any flat array name) at the top level for **access control enforcement** in PocketBase rules:

  ```pb
  @request.auth.id = owner || @request.auth.id ~ user_ids
  ```

* Keep the detailed `data.users` array with role info **only for frontend/UI logic** — PocketBase cannot enforce rules based on nested JSON fields.

* You can keep a separate `"owner"` field if you want, but remember PocketBase already tracks `_createdBy` internally, which you can use in rules.

---

### So yes — this hybrid approach is the **best practical way** to balance:

* Security (server-side enforced user access), and
* Flexibility (rich user-role data for UI/logic).

If you want, I can help with sample access rules, syncing functions, or UI ideas!
