Refined Action Context for Your System
Draft (docstatus = 0):
[Edit] [Submit] [Delete] [Clone]

Edit = continue working on draft
Submit = finalize and lock (equivalent to Salesforce's "Submit for Approval")
Delete = remove draft entirely
Clone = create copy as new draft

Submitted (docstatus = 1):
[View] [Clone] [Cancel] [Amend]

View = read-only access
Clone = create new draft copy
Cancel = set docstatus to 2 (if business rules allow)
Amend = create amendable copy (Frappe-specific workflow)

Cancelled (docstatus = 2):
[View] [Clone]

View = read-only access to cancelled document
Clone = create new draft from cancelled doc

Key Improvements from Salesforce Model
Simpler Labels:

"Submit" instead of "Submit for Approval" (clearer for business users)
"Cancel" instead of complex status changes

Always Available Actions:

Clone is available in all states (very useful for templates)
View is explicit when editing isn't allowed

Business Logic Alignment:

Amend follows Frappe's amendment workflow
Cancel respects your business rules about who can cancel

Status-Driven UI:

Buttons appear/disappear based on docstatus
No confusion about what's possible in each state

This gives you the clarity of Salesforce's approach while respecting Frappe's document lifecycle model. The key is making the docstatus consequences obvious through the available actions!
