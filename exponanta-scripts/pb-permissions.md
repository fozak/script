dont give much code, just elaborate on pocketbase implementation like user: {parent_id_customer : ["cust_abc123", "cust_xyz789"]} how this will workIf you're representing a many-to-many ACL relationship where a User item references multiple Customers like this:
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "schema": { "name": "User" },
  "data": {
    "parent_id_customer": ["cust_abc123", "cust_xyz789"]
  }
}
You're essentially saying:
"This user has access to Customer cust_abc123 and cust_xyz789."
This structure allows you to treat access to a customer as a parent relationship, which aligns perfectly with your parent-child ACL propagation model.
ðŸ§  How it works conceptually
You reverse the access direction:
Tasks â†’ Projects â†’ Customers (traditional hierarchy)
Users â†’ Customers (via data.parent_id_customer)
So now:
If a user has parent_id_customer: ["cust123", "cust456"]
They implicitly have access to any descendant (Projects, Tasks) under those customers.EditYou've identified a clever approach to implementing user-customer access control in PocketBase. Let me break down how this parent_id_customer array implementation would work:
The Core Concept
Instead of storing user permissions at every level, you're creating a direct access grant from users to customers. This means:
User â†’ Customer(s) â†’ Projects â†’ Tasks
The user's parent_id_customer array becomes their "access passport" - listing all the customer hierarchies they can enter.
How Access Resolution Works
When a user tries to access any resource, PocketBase would:

Check the user's customer access list: ["cust_abc123", "cust_xyz789"]
Trace the resource's ancestry: Does this task/project belong to cust_abc123 or cust_xyz789?
Grant or deny access based on that ancestry check

Practical Implementation Benefits
Simplified Permission Management: Instead of managing user permissions across hundreds of projects and thousands of tasks, you only manage them at the customer level.
Automatic Inheritance: When a new project is created under cust_abc123, users with that customer in their array automatically get access - no additional permission setup needed.
Efficient Queries: PocketBase can use the array to filter collections directly: "Show me all tasks where the parent customer is in this user's access list."
Real-World Scenario
Imagine Sarah is a consultant working with two clients:

Customer A (cust_abc123): Has 5 projects, 50 tasks
Customer B (cust_xyz789): Has 3 projects, 30 tasks

Sarah's user record: parent_id_customer: ["cust_abc123", "cust_xyz789"]
Now Sarah can access all 80 tasks across both customers without needing 80 individual permission entries. When Customer A adds a new project tomorrow, Sarah automatically has access.
The Elegance
This approach treats customer access as a "key" that unlocks entire hierarchies, rather than managing locks on individual doors. It's particularly powerful for multi-tenant scenarios where users need broad access within specific customer boundaries but complete isolation between customers.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.DDwhere do you see key challenges (logical) and managerialEditLogical Challenges
Inheritance Complexity: What happens when a user needs access to Customer A's projects but NOT all of them? The array approach is all-or-nothing per customer. You can't easily say "access cust_abc123 but exclude project_sensitive_merger."
Cross-Customer Collaboration: If a project involves multiple customers (joint ventures, partnerships), how do you represent that? Does the project belong to both customers? Do you duplicate it? The parent-child model breaks down here.
Granular Exceptions: Sometimes you need surgical precision - "this user can see all of Customer A except this one confidential task." The array model forces you to either compromise security or create complex workarounds.
Audit Trail Ambiguity: When access is inherited, it's harder to trace why someone has access. "Sarah accessed sensitive-task-X" - was it because she's on Customer A's list, or because of some other permission? The paper trail gets murky.
Performance at Scale: When checking access, you're potentially traversing hierarchies for every query. "Can user X access task Y?" becomes "Find task Y's customer â†’ Check if customer is in user X's array." With thousands of tasks, this gets expensive.
Managerial Challenges
Operational Blind Spots: Managers lose visibility into who can access what. Instead of seeing "Sarah has access to Projects 1, 3, 5," they see "Sarah has access to Customer A" - but what does that actually include today?
Change Management Chaos: When a customer's structure changes (new subsidiary, merged departments), access cascades unpredictably. Adding a new project under Customer A suddenly grants access to everyone on the customer list - was that intentional?
Compliance Nightmares: Auditors ask "Who had access to this financial data on March 15th?" You can't answer without reconstructing the entire customer hierarchy as it existed on that date. The simple array doesn't capture temporal changes.
Onboarding/Offboarding Risk: New employees get added to customer arrays for "easy access" but nobody tracks what that really means. When they leave, removing them from the array might revoke access to things they were supposed to keep.
Business Logic Conflicts: Sales teams often cross customer boundaries. A salesperson managing both Customer A and Customer B accounts needs access to both - but what about competitive intelligence? The model doesn't distinguish between "operational access" and "business-sensitive access."
Accountability Gaps: When something goes wrong, finger-pointing begins. "I gave them customer-level access, I didn't know they could see the M&A documents!" The gap between intent and implementation becomes a liability.
The elegant simplicity that makes this model appealing technically can become a management headache when real-world business complexity hits.RetryDDsuggest betterEditHybrid Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) + Resource-Based Model
Instead of pure inheritance, implement a layered permission system that combines role templates with explicit resource grants:
Core Structure
json{
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "access_grants": [
    {
      "scope": "customer",
      "resource_id": "cust_abc123",
      "role": "project_manager",
      "restrictions": ["no_financial_data"],
      "granted_by": "admin_xyz",
      "granted_at": "2024-01-15",
      "expires_at": "2024-12-31"
    },
    {
      "scope": "project", 
      "resource_id": "proj_sensitive_merger",
      "role": "viewer_only",
      "explicit": true
    }
  ]
}
How It Works
Role Templates Define Capabilities: project_manager role = "can view/edit projects, tasks, but not delete customers"
Scope-Level Grants: Users get roles at different hierarchy levels (customer, project, task)
Explicit Overrides: Specific resources can have explicit permissions that override inherited ones
Temporal Control: Every grant has creation date, creator, and optional expiration
Key Improvements
Granular Without Chaos: You can grant broad access (customer-level) while maintaining surgical control (project-level overrides)
Audit Trail: Every permission has a paper trail - who granted it, when, why, and when it expires
Business Logic Support: Different roles handle different business needs:

sales_rep: Customer visibility, no operational access
project_manager: Full project control, limited customer admin
consultant: Time-bounded access with automatic expiration

Scalable Queries: PocketBase can index by scope and role, making access checks efficient even with complex rules
Compliance Ready: You can answer "Who had access to X on date Y?" by replaying the grants table
Implementation Strategy
Start Simple: Begin with just customer-level roles for 80% of users
Add Complexity Gradually: Introduce project-level overrides only when business needs demand it
Automate Cleanup: Background jobs remove expired grants and notify managers of approaching expirations
Role Evolution: As business needs change, you can create new role templates without touching existing user records
This approach gives you the inheritance benefits you want while maintaining the control and visibility managers need. The key is making the common case (customer-level access) simple while keeping the complex cases (surgical permissions) possible.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.DDI am in POcketBase but using ERPnext doctypes with rolesEditERPNext PocketBase integration doctypes roles10 resultsIntroduction - Authentication - Docs - PocketBasepocketbase.ioIntroduction - How to use PocketBase - Docs - PocketBasepocketbase.ioERPNext Custom DocTypes, Actions, and Links | About Lovialovia.idGuide to Streamlining Flutter with PocketBase Backend Integrationdhiwise.comERPNext Documentationerpnext.comIntroduction - Extending PocketBase - Docs - PocketBasepocketbase.ioDocTypeerpnext.comUnderstanding DocTypesfrappe.ioIntroduction - API rules and filters - Docs - PocketBasepocketbase.ioHow to create Doctypes in ERPNext - Webkul Blogwebkul.comERPNext role permissions doctype access control user roles10 resultsmanual_erpnext_com/manual_erpnext_com/www/contents/setting-up/users-and-permissions/role-based-permissions.md at master Â· frappe/manual_erpnext_comgithub.comMastering User Roles and Permissions in ERPNext at Frappe Academy | GoTranscriptgotranscript.comRole Based Permissionserpnext.comUser Permissionserpnext.comRole Based Permissions - ERPNextcasesolved.co.ukSpecific Report Permission Setting on Role Permission Manager Â· Issue #3455 Â· frappe/erpnextgithub.comRole Permission for Page and Report doesn't work if user does not have access to the report's Ref DocType Â· Issue #17444 Â· frappe/frappegithub.comRole Permission Manager | Frappe Cloud Marketplacefrappecloud.comAdding a Role in ERPNextlinkedin.comRole Permissions â€” Tasker - ERPNext is Easy. Implementation is Hard. We're Here to Help!tasker.phAh, this changes everything! You're working with ERPNext's powerful role-based permission system but using PocketBase as the backend. This is actually a fascinating hybrid approach.
ERPNext Role Model in PocketBase Context
ERPNext has a role-based permission system. It means that you can assign Roles to Users, and set Permissions on Roles. The permission structure also allows you to define different permission rules for different fields, using a concept called Permission "Level" of a field. manual_erpnext_com/manual_erpnext_com/www/contents/setting-up/users-and-permissions/role-based-permissions.md at master Â· frappe/manual_erpnext_com
Since you're using ERPNext's doctype concepts, you can leverage their proven permission patterns:
Adapt ERPNext's Three-Layer Model
1. Role-Based Permissions (DocType level)
json{
  "role": "Sales Manager",
  "doctype": "Customer",
  "permissions": {
    "read": 1,
    "write": 1,
    "create": 1,
    "delete": 0,
    "submit": 1,
    "cancel": 0,
    "report": 1
  }
}
2. User Permissions (Document level)
User Permissions can be used to restrict access to specific documents within a DocType User Permissions
json{
  "user": "sarah@company.com",
  "doctype": "Customer", 
  "document_name": "cust_abc123",
  "permissions": ["read", "write"]
}
3. Field-Level Permissions (Column level)
json{
  "role": "Sales Rep",
  "doctype": "Customer",
  "field": "credit_limit",
  "permission_level": 2,
  "read": 0,
  "write": 0
}
Implementation Strategy for PocketBase
Collections Structure:

roles - Define role templates
role_permissions - DocType-level permissions per role
user_permissions - Document-level restrictions per user
field_permissions - Field-level access control

Permission Resolution Logic:

Start with role permissions - What can this role do with this doctype?
Apply user permissions - Is this user restricted to specific documents?
Apply field permissions - Are certain fields restricted for this role?

Key Advantages of This Approach
Familiar Mental Model: Your team already understands ERPNext permissions - no learning curve
Proven Scalability: ERPNext handles thousands of users across complex organizations with this system
Granular Control: You get document-level AND field-level control without losing the broad role-based efficiency
Business Logic Ready: ERPNext's permission levels (0,1,2) naturally handle scenarios like "Sales Rep can see customer name but not credit limit"
Challenges to Watch
Query Complexity: PocketBase will need to join multiple permission tables for each request - optimize with proper indexing
Performance: ERPNext's permission checks can be expensive - consider caching user permission matrices
Sync Complexity: If you're syncing with actual ERPNext, keeping permissions in sync becomes critical
The beauty is you get ERPNext's battle-tested permission logic with PocketBase's simplicity and real-time features. This could be the best of both worlds if implemented thoughtfully.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.DDit is stil very granularEditYou're absolutely right - ERPNext's permission system is incredibly granular by design. It's built for complex ERP scenarios where you need surgical control, but that granularity can become overwhelming.
The ERPNext Permission Problem
ERPNext gives you:

7+ permission types (read, write, create, delete, submit, cancel, report, etc.)
Field-level permissions with multiple levels
Document-level user permissions
Role-based permissions
Workflow states with different permissions per state

For a typical business app, this is overkill and creates:

Configuration paralysis - Too many options to set up
Performance overhead - Multiple permission checks per query
Management complexity - Hard to understand who can do what

Simplified Approach for PocketBase
Since you're already in PocketBase, consider a streamlined ERPNext-inspired model:
Three Permission Levels Only
json{
  "user_roles": ["sales_manager"],
  "customer_access": {
    "cust_abc123": "full",      // read/write/create
    "cust_xyz789": "read_only", // view only
    "cust_def456": "restricted" // limited fields
  }
}
Role Templates (Not Granular Permissions)
json{
  "sales_manager": {
    "customers": "full",
    "projects": "full", 
    "tasks": "own_only",
    "reports": "read_only"
  }
}
Document-Level Override Only When Needed
json{
  "explicit_grants": [
    {
      "user": "sarah@company.com",
      "resource": "proj_sensitive_merger",
      "access": "read_only"
    }
  ]
}
The Key Insight
ERPNext's granularity is necessary for ERP systems where you have accountants, HR, inventory managers, etc. all with very different needs.
For most business applications, you probably only need:

"Can see this customer's stuff" (read access)
"Can work on this customer's stuff" (read/write access)
"Can manage this customer's stuff" (full access)

The goal is to capture 90% of your business logic with 10% of ERPNext's complexity.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.DDsimplify it furtherEditUltra-Simple: Just Customer Access + Role
json{
  "user_id": "sarah_123",
  "role": "manager",
  "customers": ["cust_abc123", "cust_xyz789"]
}
That's it.
Three Roles Total

viewer - Can see everything under their customers
editor - Can modify everything under their customers
manager - Can do everything including delete

How It Works
Access Check:

Does user have this customer in their array?
Does their role allow this action?
Done.

Examples:

Sarah (manager) with customers [A,B] â†’ Can delete projects under A or B
John (editor) with customers [A] â†’ Can edit tasks under A, but not delete
Mike (viewer) with customers [B] â†’ Can only view B's data

PocketBase Implementation
Single permission check function:
javascriptfunction canAccess(user, resource, action) {
  const resourceCustomer = getResourceCustomer(resource);
  const hasCustomerAccess = user.customers.includes(resourceCustomer);
  const hasRolePermission = ROLE_PERMISSIONS[user.role][action];
  
  return hasCustomerAccess && hasRolePermission;
}
No inheritance complexity. No field-level rules. No document exceptions.
Just: "Do you have access to this customer?" + "Does your role allow this action?"
Simple enough?RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.DDsome doctypes are children and has now cusomer linked directly.EditAh, the classic ERPNext hierarchy problem! Child doctypes don't directly link to customers - they inherit through their parents.
The Chain Problem
Customer â†’ Project â†’ Task â†’ Task Comment
Task Comment has no customer field - it links to Task, which links to Project, which links to Customer.
Simple Solution: Store Customer ID Everywhere
When creating any document, automatically populate a customer_id field by walking up the chain:
json// Task Comment
{
  "task": "task_123",
  "customer_id": "cust_abc123",  // Auto-populated from task â†’ project â†’ customer
  "comment": "Work completed"
}

// Task  
{
  "project": "proj_456",
  "customer_id": "cust_abc123",  // Auto-populated from project â†’ customer
  "title": "Design mockups"
}

// Project
{
  "customer": "cust_abc123",
  "customer_id": "cust_abc123",  // Same as customer field
  "name": "Website Redesign"
}
Implementation
On Create/Update: Run a simple function that walks up the parent chain and sets customer_id
Permission Check: Always just check user.customers.includes(doc.customer_id)
No Complex Queries: Every doctype has customer_id, so no joins needed
Benefits

Same simple permission logic for all doctypes
No recursive queries to find the customer
Fast lookups - direct customer_id comparison
ERPNext compatibility - still follows the parent-child structure

This denormalizes the customer relationship but makes permissions trivial. The slight data redundancy is worth the massive simplification in access control logic.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.DDcan I reliably control access with user doctype in pocketbase (without users rules)EditYes, but with important caveats.
How It Would Work
Create a custom user_profile collection instead of using PocketBase's built-in auth:
json// user_profile collection
{
  "id": "profile_123",
  "email": "sarah@company.com",
  "password_hash": "...",
  "role": "manager", 
  "customers": ["cust_abc123", "cust_xyz789"],
  "active": true
}
Then handle auth manually:

Login: Check credentials against your user_profile collection
Session: Store user profile data in JWT/session
Access Control: Use profile data for all permission checks

The Big Problems
No Built-in Auth Features: You lose PocketBase's authentication, password reset, email verification, OAuth integration, etc. You'd need to rebuild all of this.
Security Responsibility: Password hashing, session management, CSRF protection - all becomes your responsibility. Easy to get wrong.
API Complexity: Every API call needs custom auth middleware instead of PocketBase's automatic user context.
Maintenance Burden: Authentication is complex and evolving. You're taking on a significant maintenance load.
Better Hybrid Approach
Use PocketBase's built-in auth BUT extend it:
json// Built-in users collection (managed by PocketBase)
{
  "id": "user_123",
  "email": "sarah@company.com",
  // ... PocketBase handles auth fields
}

// Your custom user_profile collection
{
  "user_id": "user_123",  // Links to PocketBase user
  "role": "manager",
  "customers": ["cust_abc123", "cust_xyz789"]
}
Result: You get PocketBase's rock-solid auth + your custom access control logic.
Recommendation: Don't reinvent authentication. Use the hybrid approach - it's much safer and simpler.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.DDso on user creation 2 reconds - standard user in users collection and user Doctypes with role and customersEditExactly! That's the cleanest approach.
Two-Record Strategy
1. PocketBase Users Collection (automatic)
json{
  "id": "user_abc123",
  "email": "sarah@company.com",
  "password": "...",
  "verified": true
  // PocketBase handles all auth stuff
}
2. Your Custom User Profile DocType
json{
  "user_id": "user_abc123",  // Links to PocketBase user
  "role": "manager",
  "customers": ["cust_abc123", "cust_xyz789"],
  "department": "Sales",
  "active": true
}
Implementation Flow
User Registration:

Create user in PocketBase users collection (handles auth)
Create corresponding record in your user_profile collection
Link them via user_id

Permission Checks:

PocketBase validates the user is authenticated
Your app queries user_profile by user_id to get role/customers
Apply your simple access control logic

Benefits:

PocketBase handles: passwords, sessions, email verification, OAuth
You handle: business logic, roles, customer access
Clean separation: Auth vs. Authorization

Tip: Set up a PocketBase hook that automatically creates the user profile record whenever a new user is created in the auth collection. This keeps the two records in sync.
This gives you the best of both worlds - bulletproof auth from PocketBase + your simple custom access control.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.DDcan I extend  "customers": ["cust_abc123", "cust_xyz789"], to also include allEditYes, absolutely! You can use a special value to indicate "all customers" access.
Simple "All Access" Flag
json{
  "user_id": "user_abc123",
  "role": "admin",
  "customers": ["*"]  // Asterisk means "all customers"
}
Or more explicit:
json{
  "user_id": "user_abc123", 
  "role": "admin",
  "customers": ["ALL"]  // Clear intention
}
Permission Check Logic
javascriptfunction hasCustomerAccess(user, customerRequested) {
  // Check for "all access" first
  if (user.customers.includes("*") || user.customers.includes("ALL")) {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Otherwise check specific customer access
  return user.customers.includes(customerRequested);
}
Mixed Access Example
json{
  "user_id": "manager_123",
  "role": "manager", 
  "customers": ["*"]  // Super admin - sees everything
}

{
  "user_id": "sales_456",
  "role": "editor",
  "customers": ["cust_abc123", "cust_xyz789"]  // Limited to specific customers
}

{
  "user_id": "consultant_789",
  "role": "viewer",
  "customers": ["cust_abc123"]  // Even more restricted
}
Benefits

Same data structure - no need for additional fields
Same permission logic - just one extra check for the "all" flag
Easy to understand - ["*"] clearly means "everything"
Flexible - You can easily promote/demote users between specific and all access

This keeps your model super simple while handling the "admin needs everything" use case elegantly.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.DDand all but NOT "cust_abc123"EditGreat point! You can extend the array to handle exclusions:
Include/Exclude Pattern
json{
  "user_id": "manager_123",
  "role": "manager",
  "customers": ["*", "!cust_abc123"]  // All customers EXCEPT cust_abc123
}
Or more complex:
json{
  "user_id": "supervisor_456", 
  "role": "editor",
  "customers": ["*", "!cust_abc123", "!cust_sensitive789"]  // All except two specific ones
}
Permission Check Logic
javascriptfunction hasCustomerAccess(user, customerRequested) {
  const hasAllAccess = user.customers.includes("*");
  const isExcluded = user.customers.includes(`!${customerRequested}`);
  const hasSpecificAccess = user.customers.includes(customerRequested);
  
  // If explicitly excluded, deny access
  if (isExcluded) {
    return false;
  }
  
  // If has "all" access and not excluded, allow
  if (hasAllAccess) {
    return true;
  }
  
  // Otherwise check specific access
  return hasSpecificAccess;
}
Real-World Examples
json// CEO - sees everything except HR sensitive data
{
  "customers": ["*", "!cust_hr_internal"]
}

// Regional Manager - sees all in region except competitor projects  
{
  "customers": ["*", "!cust_competitor_intel", "!cust_legal_matters"]
}

// Mixed access - specific customers plus all except some
{
  "customers": ["cust_abc123", "cust_def456", "*", "!cust_sensitive"]
}
This gives you the flexibility to handle complex business scenarios like "manager sees everything except confidential clients" while keeping the same simple array structure.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.DDwhat might be the simlification for small businessEditFor small businesses, you probably only need 2-3 permission levels total.
Ultra-Simple: Just Three Levels
json{
  "user_id": "sarah_123",
  "access_level": "full"  // "full", "limited", or "view"
}
That's it. No customers array. No roles. No exceptions.
Three Access Levels

view - Can see everything, edit nothing
limited - Can edit their own work + assigned tasks
full - Can do everything (owner/admin)

Why This Works for Small Business
Small Team Reality: In a 5-20 person company, you typically have:

1-2 owners/managers (full access)
2-3 senior staff (limited access)
Everyone else (view only)

Trust-Based: Small businesses run on trust. You don't need to lock down every customer from every employee.
Flexibility: As you grow, you can always add the customer array back:
json{
  "user_id": "sarah_123", 
  "access_level": "limited",
  "customers": ["cust_abc123"]  // Add later if needed
}
Permission Check
javascriptfunction canAccess(user, action) {
  if (user.access_level === "full") return true;
  if (user.access_level === "limited" && isLimitedAction(action)) return true;
  if (user.access_level === "view" && action === "read") return true;
  return false;
}
Start simple. Add complexity only when the business actually needs it.
Most small businesses can run for years with just these three levels.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.DDhow to implement using basic user.json doctype {

}EditLooking at the ERPNext User doctype, you can add your custom fields to implement the simplified access control. Here's how:
Add Custom Fields to User DocType
Add these fields to the existing User doctype:
json{
  "fieldname": "access_level",
  "fieldtype": "Select",
  "label": "Access Level",
  "options": "view\nlimited\nfull",
  "default": "view",
  "reqd": 1
},
{
  "fieldname": "customers",
  "fieldtype": "Table MultiSelect",
  "label": "Customer Access",
  "options": "User Customer Access"
}
Create Child DocType: User Customer Access
json{
  "doctype": "DocType",
  "name": "User Customer Access",
  "istable": 1,
  "fields": [
    {
      "fieldname": "customer",
      "fieldtype": "Link",
      "label": "Customer",
      "options": "Customer",
      "reqd": 1
    }
  ]
}
Permission Logic Implementation
In your PocketBase permission checks:
pythondef check_user_access(user_email, resource_customer, action):
    # Get user record
    user = frappe.get_doc("User", user_email)
    
    # Check access level
    if user.access_level == "view" and action != "read":
        return False
    
    if user.access_level == "full":
        return True
    
    # Check customer access
    user_customers = [row.customer for row in user.customers]
    
    # Handle "all" access
    if "*" in user_customers:
        # Check for exclusions
        excluded = [c.replace("!", "") for c in user_customers if c.startswith("!")]
        return resource_customer not in excluded
    
    # Check specific customer access
    return resource_customer in user_customers
Usage Example
json// User record after customization
{
  "email": "sarah@company.com",
  "full_name": "Sarah Johnson",
  "access_level": "limited",
  "customers": [
    {"customer": "cust_abc123"},
    {"customer": "cust_xyz789"}
  ]
}
This extends the existing ERPNext User doctype without breaking any existing functionality, while adding your simplified access control system.Looking at the ERPNext User doctype, you can add your custom fields to implement the simplified access control. Here's how:

## Add Custom Fields to User DocType

Add these fields to the existing User doctype:

```json
{
  "fieldname": "access_level",
  "fieldtype": "Select",
  "label": "Access Level",
  "options": "view\nlimited\nfull",
  "default": "view",
  "reqd": 1
},
{
  "fieldname": "customers",
  "fieldtype": "Table MultiSelect",
  "label": "Customer Access",
  "options": "User Customer Access"
}
```

## Create Child DocType: User Customer Access

```json
{
  "doctype": "DocType",
  "name": "User Customer Access",
  "istable": 1,
  "fields": [
    {
      "fieldname": "customer",
      "fieldtype": "Link",
      "label": "Customer",
      "options": "Customer",
      "reqd": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

## Permission Logic Implementation

In your PocketBase permission checks:

```python
def check_user_access(user_email, resource_customer, action):
    # Get user record
    user = frappe.get_doc("User", user_email)
    
    # Check access level
    if user.access_level == "view" and action != "read":
        return False
    
    if user.access_level == "full":
        return True
    
    # Check customer access
    user_customers = [row.customer for row in user.customers]
    
    # Handle "all" access
    if "*" in user_customers:
        # Check for exclusions
        excluded = [c.replace("!", "") for c in user_customers if c.startswith("!")]
        return resource_customer not in excluded
    
    # Check specific customer access
    return resource_customer in user_customers
```

## Usage Example

```json
// User record after customization
{
  "email": "sarah@company.com",
  "full_name": "Sarah Johnson",
  "access_level": "limited",
  "customers": [
    {"customer": "cust_abc123"},
    {"customer": "cust_xyz789"}
  ]
}
```

This extends the existing ERPNext User doctype without breaking any existing functionality, while adding your simplified access control system.
