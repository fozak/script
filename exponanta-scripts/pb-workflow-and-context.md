give conceptual advice on the above. we have inputDoc to start but the executeWorkflow has very limited knowleget of data nesting for instance we might have customer in inputDoc, but his email needs extraction etc. how to build more data-aware functions and approach 


ChatGPT said:
Great question — you're touching on the heart of workflow orchestration and data context management. The inputDoc is just the starting point, and as workflows grow, so does the need for rich, structured, and context-aware data flow between steps.

Here’s a conceptual breakdown and advice to evolve your approach:

🧱 1. Think in Terms of Context Propagation
Right now:

js
Copy
Edit
const ctx = { input: inputDoc };
This is fine for small flows, but quickly becomes limiting. You need a growing, structured, and queryable context object.

🔧 Improve by:
Passing ctx into every step, not just input.

Letting each step enrich ctx, not overwrite it.

Structuring ctx as a namespace:

js
Copy
Edit
const ctx = {
  input: inputDoc,
  meta: {},        // high-level info (e.g., flags, runId)
  data: {},        // derived or fetched data (e.g., customerEmail)
  steps: {}        // store results by step name
};
🧠 2. Add a Data Resolution Layer
Introduce helper functions to resolve data from the context.

Example:

js
Copy
Edit
pb.resolveValue = (ctx, path) => {
  return path.split('.').reduce((acc, part) => acc?.[part], ctx);
};
Now you can access:

js
Copy
Edit
const email = pb.resolveValue(ctx, 'input.data.customer.email');
➡️ Makes your steps data-aware without hardcoding paths inside every function.

🪢 3. Introduce Workflow Bindings
Let steps declare what they need and what they produce.

Example step:

js
Copy
Edit
{
  step: "sendWelcomeEmail",
  type: "sync",
  handler: "sendEmail",
  inputMap: {
    to: "input.data.customer.email",
    subject: "'Welcome!'",
    payload: "input.data"
  }
}
Then have a runner adapter that resolves inputMap using your data resolver before calling the function.

This enables:

Clean separation of data flow and business logic

Flexible, declarative workflows

🧩 4. Standardize Step Outputs
Each step should:

return a result

optionally assign to a context key (saveAs)

optionally emit events, logs, or flags

js
Copy
Edit
const result = fn(resolvedInput, ctx);
ctx.steps[step.step] = result;
if (step.saveAs) ctx.data[step.saveAs] = result;
Now all future steps can depend on it via ctx.data.<saveAs>.

🧭 5. Use Doctype Schemas to Guide Enrichment
Just like Frappe does: schemas can tell you:

What fields exist

What links to resolve

What related data to fetch

You can build a helper like:

js
Copy
Edit
pb.enrichDoc = async (doc, schema) => {
  // Fetch linked records based on schema fields
};
Now, a single step can:

Load a document

Enrich it via its schema

Store it in ctx

🏗 Example Future runProcess Enhancement:
js
Copy
Edit
for (const step of process) {
  const resolvedInput = resolveInput(step.inputMap, ctx);
  const result = await pb[step.handler](resolvedInput, ctx);
  
  if (step.saveAs) ctx.data[step.saveAs] = result;
  ctx.steps[step.step] = result;
}
🔄 Summary of Conceptual Shifts
Current Model	Evolved Model
One inputDoc	Dynamic ctx with input, data, meta
Hardcoded fields	Resolvers using dot-paths
Rigid steps	Declarative steps with inputMap, saveAs
Limited chaining	Rich context for chaining + dependency tracking
Flat data	Enriched nested data via schema

Let me know if you want a concrete version of this enhanced runner. This evolution lets your workflows scale cleanly — and makes them both powerful and explainable.








You said:
how about backwards, reverse order thinking, if later newEmail(customer.email) is needed so we need customer.email -> resolver -> should be at the time of execution


ChatGPT said:
Yes — this reverse order, "data-on-demand" thinking is extremely powerful and fits perfectly with how smart workflows should evolve.

Instead of eagerly loading everything upfront, your idea suggests a lazy, traceable, and contextual resolution of data just-in-time, when and if it's needed. Let's expand on this design pattern.

🧠 Concept: Reverse-Driven, Demand-Based Resolution
If step X needs customer.email, then that value should be resolved when step X runs — not before.

This means you:

Define what each step needs (its dependencies)

Use a resolver engine to fetch/compute those values on-the-fly

Store results in ctx to avoid redundant work

🧩 Step Definition Example
js
Copy
Edit
{
  step: "sendEmail",
  type: "sync",
  handler: "sendEmail",
  inputs: {
    to: "resolve:customer.email",
    subject: "'Welcome to our store!'",
    payload: "input.data"
  }
}
🔁 Resolution Engine (pb.resolveValue)
Create a resolver that can:

Follow dot-paths

Call resolver functions dynamically

Use schema awareness or plugins

js
Copy
Edit
pb.resolveValue = async (ctx, path) => {
  // Already stored
  if (path.startsWith('ctx.')) {
    return path.split('.').slice(1).reduce((o, p) => o?.[p], ctx);
  }

  // Resolver-style: `resolve:customer.email`
  if (path.startsWith('resolve:')) {
    const prop = path.replace('resolve:', '');
    const parts = prop.split('.');

    // Try from input doc
    if (parts[0] === 'customer') {
      const customerId = ctx.input?.data?.customer;
      if (!ctx.data.customer && customerId) {
        ctx.data.customer = await pb.getDoc(customerId);
      }
      return parts.slice(1).reduce((o, p) => o?.[p], ctx.data.customer);
    }

    // fallback
    throw new Error(`No resolver for: ${path}`);
  }

  // If it's just a string value or expression
  return eval(path);
};
🏃 Enhanced runProcess
js
Copy
Edit
for (const step of process) {
  let resolvedInputs = {};
  for (const key in step.inputs || {}) {
    resolvedInputs[key] = await pb.resolveValue(ctx, step.inputs[key]);
  }

  const fn = pb[step.handler];
  if (!fn) throw new Error(`Missing function ${step.handler}`);

  const result = await fn(resolvedInputs, ctx);

  if (step.saveAs) {
    ctx.data[step.saveAs] = result;
  }

  ctx.steps[step.step] = result;
}
✅ Benefits
Feature	Advantage
🧠 Lazy resolution	Only resolves what’s actually needed
🔁 Reusable context	No duplicate lookups
📦 Backward traceability	You can log why/when data was resolved
⚙ Schema-driven plug-ins	Add special resolvers for links, calculated fields
🧱 Future AI integration	Steps could "ask" for needed data

💡 Bonus: Add Logging
js
Copy
Edit
console.log(`🔍 Resolving: ${key} <- ${step.inputs[key]} => ${resolvedInputs[key]}`);
This will give you runtime introspection, essential for debugging dynamic workflows.

🚀 Summary
Your idea:

“If I need customer.email, it should resolve automatically at that time”

…is the foundation of declarative, scalable, and intelligent automation.

You’re moving from imperative orchestration toward a rule-driven execution engine. That’s the right direction for building modern automation layers.

Let me know if you'd like a reusable wrapper or code generator for this model.








You said:
I am asking not about ondemand generation, but on building univeral naming of fileds and data in workflow context.


ChatGPT said:
Ah — thank you for clarifying. You're not focused on when data is resolved (on-demand vs eager), but rather how to name and refer to fields and data across workflow steps — so it’s traceable, universal, and extensible.

Let’s approach this from the naming strategy perspective for a workflow system.

🧠 The Problem
When you write:

js
Copy
Edit
if (!input.customer) throw new Error("Missing customer");
…you are using input.customer, but what if that’s a link, or the full customer is stored elsewhere like:

input.data.customer

or later resolved as ctx.customer

Similarly, as your workflows grow, fields like customer_email, order_id, invoice.total, etc. become hard to trace or may be duplicated.

✅ Goals for Naming Strategy
Consistent field paths (input.data.total, ctx.invoice.name)

Traceable source (where it came from — input vs computed)

Universal field references across all doctypes

Composable (allow nesting or derived values)

🧩 Proposed Structure: Context-Aware Data Map
You already have something like this:

js
Copy
Edit
const ctx = {
  input: { doctype: "Sales Order", data: { customer: "CUST-001" } },
  invoice: { name: "INV-123", data: { total: 1200 } },
  customer: { name: "CUST-001", data: { email: "a@b.com" } },
};
But field access is inconsistent.

🏗 Suggested Naming Convention
Let’s use a dot-path convention, like:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
input.customer
input.data.customer
invoice.data.total
customer.data.email
But Add: A Thin Field Resolver Layer
Create a standard way to refer to any value:

js
Copy
Edit
pb.getValue(ctx, "invoice.total")   // auto-maps to ctx.invoice.data.total
pb.getValue(ctx, "customer.email")  // ctx.customer.data.email
pb.getValue(ctx, "input.customer")  // ctx.input.data.customer
Example Implementation
js
Copy
Edit
pb.getValue = function (ctx, path) {
  const [source, ...fields] = path.split('.');
  const base = ctx[source];
  if (!base) return undefined;

  const data = base.data || base;
  return fields.reduce((obj, key) => obj?.[key], data);
};
🧩 Example Usage in Workflows
js
Copy
Edit
{
  step: "sendEmail",
  type: "sync",
  handler: "sendEmail",
  inputs: {
    to: "customer.email",
    subject: "'Order Confirmation'",
    payload: "invoice"
  }
}
During execution:

js
Copy
Edit
const to = pb.getValue(ctx, step.inputs.to); // → ctx.customer.data.email
✨ Optional: Field Tags for Metadata
You could even mark fields in schema like:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "fields": [
    { "fieldname": "customer", "label": "Customer", "type": "Link", "target": "Customer", "tags": ["emailSource"] }
  ]
}
So the engine can know where to find email by scanning field tags like emailSource.

🧱 Benefits of Standard Naming
Benefit	Description
✅ Predictable	Anyone writing a workflow can rely on standard field names
🔍 Debuggable	Logs and paths are human-readable (ctx.invoice.data.total)
🔁 Reusable	Can apply same logic across doctypes
⚙ Extendable	With field mapping, link expansion, or AI suggestions

🧪 Bonus: Prefix Convention (optional)
You could prefix field paths for clarity:

bash
Copy
Edit
$input.customer
$customer.email
$invoice.total
Which getValue() would recognize and resolve.

✅ Summary
To make workflow context more universal and logical, you should:

✅ Standardize field access using a path convention: source.field.subfield

✅ Resolve values dynamically with a helper like pb.getValue(ctx, path)

✅ Avoid hardcoding data locations (data.customer, input.data.customer) — let the system resolve

✅ Optionally add field metadata to guide workflow field resolution

This will scale beautifully as workflows grow in complexity and span multiple doctypes. Let me know if you’d like a schema-aware version of getValue() that resolves links automatically.
