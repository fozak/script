no, I need the real id of child record in pocketbase, so I assume its a kind of two steps operation - generate the child with some name and and then set name with  result += chars + realid

Edit
You're absolutely right! It's a two-step operation. Here's the corrected code:

Replace the addRow function with:

javascript
const addRow = useCallback(async () => {
  // Step 1: Create the child record with a temporary name
  const newChild = await pb.collection('item').create({
    doctype: field.options,
    name: `temp-${Date.now()}`, // Temporary name
    data: { parent: selectedTarget.name, parenttype: selectedTarget.doctype, parentfield: field.fieldname }
  });
  
  // Step 2: Update the name with the proper format using the real PocketBase ID
  const finalName = `${field.options.replace(/\s+/g, '-')}-${newChild.id}`;
  const updatedChild = await pb.collection('item').update(newChild.id, {
    name: finalName
  });
  
  // Use the updated record for the state
  setChildRows(prev => [...prev, { ...newChild, name: finalName }]);
}, [field]);
This will:

Step 1: Create the child record with a temporary name (e.g., temp-1642534567890)
Step 2: Update the record's name to use the format Sales-Invoice-Item-eqqxyqu3lraijec where eqqxyqu3lraijec is the actual PocketBase record ID that was generated
Update the local state with the final name
So if the child doctype is "Sales Invoice Item" and PocketBase generates ID eqqxyqu3lraijec, the final name will be Sales-Invoice-Item-eqqxyqu3lraijec.





dont give code tell if I can set the id of record of pocketbase by myself

Edit
No, you cannot set the ID of a PocketBase record yourself. PocketBase automatically generates unique IDs for all records when they are created, and this ID cannot be overridden or specified during creation.

That's why the two-step approach is necessary:

Create the record (PocketBase assigns the ID)
Update the record's name field using the generated ID
The ID is immutable once the record is created - it's PocketBase's primary key and cannot be changed after creation.




and reset id after creation?

Edit
No, you cannot reset or change the ID of a PocketBase record after creation. The ID is immutable and permanent once the record is created.

The ID serves as the primary key and is used internally by PocketBase for:

Database relationships
Record identification
API endpoints
Internal references
Once assigned, it cannot be modified, deleted, or reassigned. This is a fundamental constraint of PocketBase's architecture to maintain data integrity and referential consistency.

So the two-step approach (create with temp name, then update the name field with the real ID) is the only way to achieve what you want.
