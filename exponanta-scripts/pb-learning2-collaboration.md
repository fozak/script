Great — collaborative functionality is the **next logical step** once you have individual records working.

Let’s lay out a **step-by-step plan** for collaborative features in your PocketBase + JS setup. You can roll this out in stages depending on how "live" and real-time you want it.

---

## ✅ Phase 1: **Basic Collaboration (User Permissions + History)**

### 1. **User Ownership and Permissions**

Make sure each record has a creator and optionally a list of collaborators:

```json
{
  "owner": "user123",
  "collaborators": ["user456", "user789"]
}
```

In PocketBase:

* Use `@request.auth.id = owner || @request.auth.id ~ collaborators` in collection rules to restrict access.
* Optional: Allow “public view” by adding a `public: true` flag.

### 2. **Record-Level History / Snapshots**

When user clicks Save, instead of overwriting:

* Push current `code`, `schema`, and `data` into a `history` array:

```js
{
  history: [
    { savedAt: '2025-07-08T13:00', code: '...', schema: {...}, data: {...} }
  ]
}
```

You can automate this in your frontend before sending the update to PocketBase.

## ✅ Phase 2: **Live Collaboration (Real-time Edits)**

PocketBase doesn't offer built-in WebSockets per record yet, but you can simulate it:

### 3. **Polling or Subscribing for Record Changes**

Use PocketBase’s real-time API to **subscribe** to updates:

```js
pb.collection("code").subscribe(recordId, function (e) {
  if (e.action === "update") {
    // Someone else updated the record, pull latest and sync
    console.log("Record updated by collaborator", e.record);
  }
});
```

Use this to sync fields like `code` or `data` between users.

### 4. **User Presence Tracking (Optional)**

Create a temporary collection like `editing_sessions`:

```json
{
  "userId": "user123",
  "recordId": "abc123",
  "lastActive": "2025-07-08T14:03"
}
```

* Show avatars of who is editing what.
* Clean up sessions using expiration or background cron.

---

## ✅ Phase 3: **Merge and Conflict Management**

If users are editing simultaneously, handle it like:

* **Last write wins** (simplest)
* **Lock per section** (e.g. code is locked when User A edits)
* **Merge UI** that shows diffs before accepting conflicting updates

You can also support a **commenting system** (e.g. discuss parts of schema or widget logic):

```json
comments: [
  { user: "user456", field: "schema", text: "Should this be required?", time: "..." }
]
```

---

## ✅ Bonus: Realtime Cursor Sharing & Co-Editing (Advanced)

If you want real-time typing/co-editing like Google Docs or Replit:

* Use **Yjs** or **Automerge** for CRDT-based real-time collaboration.
* Store state locally and periodically push snapshots to PocketBase.

Would you like a code sample for:

* PocketBase record `subscribe()` to detect updates?
* Collaborative “editing\_sessions” collection setup?
* Simple merge UI mockup?
