# scripts

1. Added DataTables:
- Included jQuery and DataTables CDN links
- Initialized DataTable with configuration
- Added proper table structure

2. Table Structure:
- Three columns: content, link, and actions
- URL extracted from the key for the link column
- Delete button in actions column

3. Features:
- Search functionality (built into DataTables)
- Pagination
- Sorting (except for actions column)
- Column width definitions
- Links open in new tab

4. Improvements:
- Wider popup (800px) to accommodate table
- Better organization of data
- More professional look

The rest of your extension files (manifest.json, content.js, background.js) remain the same. Would you like me to add any additional DataTables features or modify the current setup?
