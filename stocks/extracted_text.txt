explain 1998-2000 internet bubble in nasdaq and crash by timeline of key events
Jupyternaut
11:18 AM
The late 1990s saw the emergence of the Internet and technology as significant drivers of economic growth, leading to the well-known "dot-com bubble." The Nasdaq Composite Index, heavily weighted with technology stocks, experienced rapid growth during this period, followed by a significant crash in the early 2000s. Below is a timeline of key events related to the Internet bubble and its subsequent crash:
Timeline of Key Events (1998-2000)
¶
¶
1998
¶
¶
January 1998
: The Nasdaq Composite Index was on a significant upward trend, fueled by investor enthusiasm for Internet-based companies. The index closed at around 1,455 points.
March 1998
: Google was founded, representing the rise of new Internet technologies that would significantly impact the tech landscape.
1999
¶
¶
March 1999
: The IPO of
Boca Research
, a leading tech company, saw a 200% increase on its first day of trading, igniting further interest in tech stocks.
April 1999
: The Nasdaq surpassed 2,000 points for the first time, marking a significant milestone in tech stock valuation.
September 1999
: The growth continued, and the Nasdaq reached 3,000 points, driven by a surge in IPOs of Internet companies. Companies like eBay, Amazon, and Cisco saw exponential stock price increases.
2000
¶
¶
January 2000
: The Nasdaq hit its all-time high of
5,048.62
points on March 10, 2000. This peak was fueled by speculation and investment in numerous unprofitable tech companies and dot-coms.
March 2000
: Concerns began to arise about the sustainability of the dot-com boom. Analysts started to warn about overvaluation and the potential risks associated with investing in unproven Internet companies.
April 2000
: The Nasdaq began to decline, dropping below 5,000 points for the first time since its peak.
June 2000
: The decline accelerated, and the Nasdaq fell below 4,000 points. Investors began to panic as many dot-com companies posted disappointing earnings.
September 2000
: Major tech stocks, including Cisco and Dell, reported earnings that fell short of expectations, further eroding investor confidence.
October 2000
: The Nasdaq dropped below 3,000 points, reflecting a loss of over 40% from its peak. The market began to realize that many Internet companies were not profitable and had unsustainable business models.
Aftermath
¶
¶
2001
: The Nasdaq continued to decline, and many dot-com companies went bankrupt, including pets.com and boo.com. The crash led to a broader market downturn, affecting not only tech stocks but also the entire stock market.
2002
: The Nasdaq bottomed out at around 1,114 points in October 2002, representing a decline of nearly 78% from its peak in March 2000.
Conclusion
¶
¶
The dot-com bubble was characterized by speculative investing in Internet companies, leading to significant overvaluation of many tech stocks. The subsequent crash highlighted the dangers of investing in companies without solid business fundamentals. The lessons learned from this period continue to influence investor behavior and regulatory practices in the technology sector today.

what were the P/S rates for nasdaq in 1999 for established
Jupyternaut
11:21 AM
In 1999, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratios for companies listed on the Nasdaq, particularly those that were considered established, varied significantly depending on the industry and individual company performance. During this period, technology and Internet companies often had inflated valuations due to investor enthusiasm and speculation.
Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratios in 1999
¶
Established Companies
:
Established tech companies like
Microsoft
,
Cisco
, and
Oracle
typically had P/S ratios ranging from
5 to 15
.
For example, Microsoft had a P/S ratio of approximately
10
in 1999, reflecting its strong market position and consistent revenue growth.
Internet Companies
:
Many established Internet companies like
Amazon
and
eBay
had P/S ratios that could be significantly higher, often exceeding
30
or even
50
due to their rapid revenue growth and high investor expectations.
Amazon, for instance, had a P/S ratio of around
40
at times in 1999, reflecting its aggressive expansion and market potential despite not being profitable.
General Market Context
:
In general, the average P/S ratio for companies in the Nasdaq during 1999 was quite elevated, often exceeding
10
, driven by the tech boom and the high valuations applied to growth stocks.
Key Takeaways
¶
The P/S ratios for established Nasdaq companies in 1999 were significantly higher than historical norms due to the bullish market sentiment surrounding technology and Internet stocks.
This period is often cited as an example of the dangers of excessive speculation and the disconnect between stock prices and fundamental company performance.
Conclusion
¶
If you need more specific data or P/S ratios for particular companies during that time, you may need to refer to historical financial databases or reports from financial analysts from that era. If there's anything else you'd like to know or further details on specific companies, feel free to ask!

what are last 3 years P/S rates
Jupyternaut
11:22 AM
As of my last knowledge update in October 2023, I don't have real-time access to current financial data, including the latest price-to-sales (P/S) ratios for companies or indices. However, I can guide you on how to find this information and discuss general trends in P/S ratios over recent years.
Finding Current P/S Ratios
¶
To find the most recent P/S ratios for the last three years, you can:
Financial News Websites
: Websites like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or Bloomberg provide updated financial metrics, including P/S ratios. You can search for individual stocks or indices.
Stock Market Analysis Platforms
: Platforms such as Morningstar, Seeking Alpha, or Zacks offer detailed financial data, including historical P/S ratios for many companies.
Market Research Reports
: Some financial institutions and research firms publish reports on industry trends, including average P/S ratios by sector.
General Trends in P/S Ratios (2021-2023)
¶
While I can't provide the exact numbers, here are some general observations about P/S ratios in recent years:
2021
: Following the COVID-19 pandemic, many tech companies experienced significant growth, leading to an increase in valuations. P/S ratios for established tech firms remained elevated, often exceeding historical averages.
2022
: With rising interest rates and inflation concerns, there was a market correction, particularly in the tech sector. Many high-growth stocks saw their P/S ratios decline as investors became more cautious.
2023
: The market showed signs of stabilization, but valuations remained varied. Some sectors, especially those related to AI and cloud computing, continued to have high P/S ratios, while traditional industries had more modest valuations.
Example of P/S Ratios for Prominent Companies
¶
To illustrate, here are hypothetical examples of P/S ratios for prominent companies in the tech sector, noting the trend over the years:
Company A (e.g., Microsoft)
:
2021: P/S Ratio = 10
2022: P/S Ratio = 8
2023: P/S Ratio = 9
Company B (e.g., Amazon)
:
2021: P/S Ratio = 45
2022: P/S Ratio = 30
2023: P/S Ratio = 35
Conclusion

Market Correction
: By 2022, many of these companies had seen their P/S ratios decrease as the market corrected itself, particularly after the pandemic-driven tech surge. This was partly due to rising interest rates and a shift in investor sentiment toward more traditional valuation metrics.
Growth vs. Value
: Some companies like Amazon and NVIDIA, which were seen as high-growth stocks in 1999, experienced significant changes in their P/S ratios by 2022. Amazon's P/S ratio dropped considerably, indicating a more cautious investor approach, while NVIDIA's P/S ratio remained relatively high as the demand for GPUs and AI technology surged.

when are typical Nasdaq seasonal declines then
Jupyternaut
11:36 AM
Seasonal declines in the Nasdaq Composite Index, as well as in other equity markets, are often influenced by various factors, including market sentiment, economic cycles, and historical trading patterns. Historically, the Nasdaq has exhibited certain trends where declines are more common during specific periods of the year. Here are some typical seasonal patterns observed:
Common Seasonal Declines in the Nasdaq
¶
January Effect
:
Many investors anticipate a rally in January following the end-of-year tax selling in December. However, there can be a pullback in late January as profit-taking occurs after the initial gains.
Sell in May and Go Away
:
This adage suggests that the stock market tends to perform poorly in the summer months. Historically, the period from May to October has seen lower returns compared to other months, with notable declines often occurring in September.
September Weakness
:
Historically, September is one of the weakest months for the stock market, including the Nasdaq. Various factors contribute to this, such as seasonal patterns in fund flows, end-of-summer portfolio adjustments, and investor behavior after the summer vacation period.
Post-Earnings Season
:
After the earnings season (which generally concludes in late January and late July), there may be increased volatility and potential declines as investors reassess their positions based on earnings reports.
End-of-Year Volatility
:
December can also see volatility as traders adjust their portfolios before year-end. While December is often positive due to the holiday rally, the unpredictability of earnings reports and investor sentiment can lead to declines.
Notable Declines in History
¶
Dot-Com Bubble Burst (2000-2002)
: The Nasdaq experienced significant declines during this period, particularly around March 2000 and again in late 2001 and early 2002.
Financial Crisis (2007-2009)
: The Nasdaq saw declines starting in late 2007 and accelerating through 2008, with significant drops in September and October during the height of the financial crisis.
COVID-19 Pandemic (2020)
: A sharp decline occurred in March 2020 as the pandemic's impact became evident, followed by a rapid recovery.
Conclusion
¶
While historical trends can provide insight, it's important to remember that past performance is not always indicative of future results. Various external factors, including economic conditions, interest rates, and geopolitical events, can influence market movements. Investors should always conduct thorough research and consider current market conditions when making investment decisions.
