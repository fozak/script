**Social Hierarchy and Class Structure:**

*   **How is social status determined in the future?** Is  happenning in 2172 in future Russia it still based on wealth, this is a variation of capitalizm with specific scructure. The access to well being is still dependent on currency. 

*   **Human improvement** People has access and actively using cloning and neuroimprovements. 

*   **New class:biorobots** People has access and actively using cloning and neuroimprovements. 

*   **How rigid is the social hierarchy?** There is limitied mobility,  people trapped in their pre-determined roles.The *illusion* of social mobility exist for middle class.

*   **What are the new social elites like?** Are they tech billionaires, political power brokers, genetically enhanced individuals, or something else entirely?
*   **How does Anna's position in this hierarchy influence her choices and her fate?** Is she trapped by her social standing, or does she have opportunities to break free?

* **biorobot class** most prominently featured is the "fabricant." 

Here's a breakdown of what's known about them:

Appearance and Function: Fabricants are artificially created beings, essentially clones, designed for servitude. They are like people physically attractive and not and meticulously crafted to perform specific tasks. They typically have less  lifespan as people in 2170s (people are around 120 year).

Social Status: They are considered people with limited egal rights. They are bred and trained for specific roles, primarily in service industries (e.g., waitresses, entertainers, ). Their lives (are controlled by the corporation that owns them - /think about) - NOT SO radical Control Mechanisms: Fabricants are controlled through a combination of genetic programming, behavioral conditioning, and social control. They are programmed to be obedient and compliant, and they are punished for any deviation from their assigned roles.

Technological Aspects: They're implied to be biologically grown, not mechanically built, hence the "bio" prefix. This makes their creation more about advanced genetic engineering than traditional robotics. They are not worse then people. 


* **Borders between biorobot class and people are dissolved, fabricants just has have civil rights limitations** People can upgrade themselves by additing cloned organs and neuroparts and have right to updrade, fabricants can not.

* **Relationships between fabricant class and people are dissolved, fabricants just has have civil rights limitations** Relationships are not prohibited. Some new social norms and stereotypes created

* **Actors** Relationships are not prohibited. Some new social norms and stereotypes created

**Example:** /write .

* **Key Changes and Explanations:**

Replaced Nobility with Corporate Power: "Prince" and "Count" are replaced with indicators of corporate power ("Director-General") or remnants of old-world nobility ("Princeling", "Legacy"). Overall old oligarghy is being replaces by newer system. The old aristocratic system has been replaced by a power hierarchy based on corporate influence and technological advancement. 

New Social Status Indicators: Social status is defined through various terms. "Legacy" indicates generational wealth and influence, while "New Money" refers to those who have recently acquired wealth through tech or business ventures.

Updated Occupations: Landowners become "Agrarian Tech Pioneers," reflecting the integration of technology into agriculture.

1st key struggle is between legacy and new money is that legacy has both resources (money and relatively expensive fabricants as well as access to land). The clean agreculture products is benefit of elite, the rest are consuming modified food. The new money wants to get more access to the land and have access to clean production. 

Fabricants: Fabricants replace servants, as they would be the expected form of domestic labor in this time period.

Social Commentary: Activists replace the penniless characters in the original. These positions illustrate the inequality of power and wealth in the novel. 

Things to Consider for the Modernized Story:

The "Legacy" Class: How does being a "Legacy" affect someone's opportunities and expectations? Are there benefits and drawbacks to being born into a powerful family?

Corporate Power: What are the ethics and responsibilities of corporations in this future? How do they influence government and society? They are similar to 19th sentury

Technological Inequality: What is the divide between those who have access to advanced technology and those who don't? How does it affect their lives and opportunities?
