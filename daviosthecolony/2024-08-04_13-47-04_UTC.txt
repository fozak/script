Forget the ordinary cookies – today, we're indulging in a sophisticated sweet tooth celebration at Davio's!
National Chocolate Chip Cookie Day calls for a delightful pairing: our chocolate chip biscotti dunked in a rich, aromatic espresso. The perfect balance of textures and flavors – a dunkable delight for any cookie monster (or coffee connoisseur)!
Come raise a cup (and a biscotti) with us!
