It's National Bacon Lovers Day, and we're not just throwing some bacon bits on a salad (although, those are delicious too!). At Davio's, we celebrate with our legendary Steakhouse Burger featuring a juicy patty, melty Vermont cheddar, and the star of the show - crispy, thick-cut bacon. All tied together with our addictive herb aioli.
This ain't your average bacon burger. This is a bacon masterpiece!
