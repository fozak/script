National Watermelon Day? Davio's is grilling it up!
Forget the ordinary, this National Watermelon Day treat yourself to our show-stopping grilled watermelon salad! Imagine succulent watermelon slices, perfectly charred on the grill, paired with peppery arugula, creamy feta cheese, and crispy prosciutto. A tangy touch of pickled onion and refreshing cucumber add another layer of flavor, while our aged balsamic reduction brings everything together in a symphony of sweet, savory, and acidic notes.
It's a taste of summer reimagined! Come celebrate National Watermelon Day with a Davio's twist.
