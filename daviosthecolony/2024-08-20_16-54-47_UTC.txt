Looking for a upscale dinner spot after visiting @worldsprings?🍽🍸 

What better way to end a #daycation in The Colony then a nice steakhouse dinner!🥩 I enjoyed my visit to @daviosthecolony which is 5 min from World Springs at the @grandscapetx ! 

This two level restaurant serves really good Italian steakhouse and seafood! They are based in Boston which is cool because they import all their seafood from Boston and its really good! 🦐🦞🦀 

The scallops and crab cake were amazing and fresh and I really likes the Filet Mignon! They have a great selection of desserts to choose from as well! So I highly recommend visiting Davios for lunch or dinner!💕 #sponsored #FFFierceTravels #FFFierceFoodie #daviosrestaurant #visitthecolony #worldsprings #grandscape #dfwfoodie #dallasfoodie #dallasfoodblogger
