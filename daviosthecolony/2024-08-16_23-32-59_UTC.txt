Meet our new Executive Chef Justin Albertson! 👋@grandscapetx 

Justin Albertson was born in Ames, IA, and grew up in Bellevue, NE. With 14 years of experience in the culinary industry, he has honed his skills in various locations, including Nebraska, Kansas, and Austin. He credits his father as the most influential figure in his life, especially in shaping his decision to become a chef. “My dad was a chef when I was younger, and I always wanted to be like him,” Albertson reflects.

Albertson’s cooking style is best described as elevated modern American with a strong Italian influence. “What I love most about being a chef is the creative aspect and the ability to positively influence so many people’s lives and days,” he shares. Despite his passion, he admits that the long hours can be challenging. He also has a particular distaste for the overuse of truffle oil, preferring the richness of fresh truffles instead.
