                    The File System API allows to read and write native files on disk of the host system, and make
                    in-place writes. There's a dedicated file system (called Origin private file system / OPFS) that
                    websites can access without having to first prompt the user for access, but that's sufficient for
                    the purposes of a database. Reads happen via File / Blob and writes using WritableStream. I have not
                    researched how random access read/write works.
                    (The File System Access API is a different variation of the API, for arbitary file access using a
                    file picker, and cannot write in-place, so it's not relevant here.)

                    A future for SQL on the web
                    James Long
                    August 12, 2021

                    I discovered something absurd recently and I’m very excited to tell you about it.

                    The end result is absurd-sql, and it’s a persistent backend for SQLite on the web. That means it
                    doesn’t have to load the whole db into memory, and writes persist. In this post I will explain the
                    absurdities of the web’s storage APIs (mainly IndexedDB), show how SQLite provides a 10x perf
                    improvement, explain all the cool tricks that make it work, and explain the locking/transactional
                    semantics that make it robust.

                    —

                    If you are writing a web app today, you’ll probably choose IndexedDB to store data. It’s the only
                    option for something database-like that works across all browsers.

                    As you attempt to build a local app, you will quickly find that it’s a poor database to build an
                    entire app around. Sure, it might be fine for smal</td>

A future for SQL on the web
James Long
August 12, 2021

I discovered something absurd recently and I’m very excited to tell you about it.

The end result is absurd-sql, and it’s a persistent backend for SQLite on the web. That means it doesn’t have to load the whole db into memory, and writes persist. In this post I will explain the absurdities of the web’s storage APIs (mainly IndexedDB), show how SQLite provides a 10x perf improvement, explain all the cool tricks that make it work, and explain the locking/transactional semantics that make it robust.

—

If you are writing a web app today, you’ll probably choose IndexedDB to store data. It’s the only option for something database-like that works across all browsers.

                    I am developing a userscript for Tampermonkey and storing it on private Github, that belongs to my
                    company. I can't upload the code on a public server. The auto update feature of the script doesn't
                    seem to work.

                    Is Tampermonkey using its own servers to check for updates?

                    Is it possible to make userscript auto update itself from private domain?

Is Tampermonkey using its own servers to check for updates?

                    The File System Standard introduces an origin private file system (OPFS) as a storage endpoint
                    private to the origin of the page and not visible to the user that provides optional access to a
                    special kind of file that is highly optimized for performance.

                    The cult of Obsidian: Why people are obsessed with the note-taking app

                    The indie darling rejects everything you know about modern software. And its strategy is working.

                    A few years ago, Nick Milo was using a folder full of plain text files for notes when he found out
                    about Obsidian.

                    The app had just launched in beta, and was getting some buzz on a productivity forum that Milo liked
                    to frequent. Obsidian gave structure to text files in a way that resembled more popular apps such as
                    Notion and Evernote, and it didn’t take long for him to get hooked on the app.

                    “Immediately, I recognized that they had cracked the code,” he says.

                    An "Origin Private File System" (OPFS) is a storage area within a web browser that allows websites
                    to access files without needing to explicitly ask the user for permission first, as it is considered
                    private to the website's domain and not visible to the user in their regular file system;
                    essentially providing a hidden, sandboxed storage space for each website to use.&nbsp;
                    Key points about OPFS:
                    No user prompts:
                    Unlike accessing files on a user's local system, OPFS does not require a permission prompt to read
                    or write data because it is isolated to the website's domain.&nbsp;
                    Private to the origin:
                    Each website has its own separate OPFS, meaning data stored by one website cannot be accessed by

                    The evident decline of Evernote, which makes me sad

                    Over the years, due to my academic position and my business activity, I have introduced Evernote to
                    hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of people, from family and friends, to colleagues at the University
                    and to customers and suppliers. Many people over the years thanked me for this help, and asked for
                    opinions and we all progressed using the tool. Evernote was, without a doubt, the best application
                    for taking notes and not only that, it had an ecosystem that was set up and well oiled. We all liked
                    that.

                    But life evolves, Evernote tried to follow the bandwagon of modernity, led by Notion in the first
