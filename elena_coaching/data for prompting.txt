Are you a helping Bully?
Coaching with compassion is more powerful than coaching for compliance. But we often allow our good intentions and urgency to push us into giving advice, telling others what they should do, and as a result we become helping bullies.

Real Self: In Intentional Change Theory, I claim that the Real Self is the person that others experience and observe. It is not what you think of yourself. The reason is that since Ed Hollander's work in the late 1950's, we know that a person's assessment of their behavior and skills is delusional. Professor Scott Taylor and his colleagues have shown repeatedly in recent years that profound gender differences occur in self-assessment (i.e., professional women are typically under-estimators, professional men are typically over-estimators). This results in self-assessment being less valid for predicting a person's behavior. Self-assessment is useful as a part of coaching (i.e., the person's mental model of themself) and when studying values or attitudes (i.e., internal phenomenon). hashtag#coaching hashtag#humanresourcedevelopment hashtag#leadershipdevelopment hashtag#assessment

Change is difficult. Sustained, desired change is relatively rare given the amount of time and resources spent on it. Part of the challenge is that we don't understand the distribution of human behavior and performance. Actual behavior, performance, and change is seldom distributed on a normal (Gaussian) distribution. It is almost always discontinuous or something closer to a power curve. So what you ask? When we analyze change and assume that the average or mean is meaningful, and that outliers aee to be tossed, and that each moment or occurrence is independent of others, we make foolish mistakes. Read more in: Boyatzis, R.E., & Dhar, Udayan (2023). When normal if not normal: A theory of the  non-linear and discontinuous process of desired change and its managerial implications.

A Culture of Development involves listening to others, focusing on their development desires, dreams, and values (not the organization's). It is a style of conversing which we call coaching with compassion. The contrast is that the Culture of Performance often involves telling as a style, setting and then giving goals and performance expectations to others, or telling others how they have to change to do well. It is a style of conversing which we call Coaching for Compliance. BOTH are needed in organizations. But don't confuse them. They invoke antagonistic neural networks, hormonal systems, and affect in each person. That is why you cannot pursue them the same way. That is, setting performance goals is reasonable. Setting development goals does not help or motivate development -- it actually does the opposite.

A Culture of Development (COD) promotes a dominant value of growth and innovation, while a Culture of Performance (COP) promotes a dominant value of efficiency. In COD growth, learning and adaptation are rewarded. In COP results and output to projections (budgets) are rewarded. The challenge is in enacting these complementary cultures without making one appear to be more important or better than the other. Any ideas?

As we have said in our recent publications, a Culture of Development (COD) focuses on employees or staff as their primary stakeholder. A culture of performance (COP) often focuses on investors or stockholders as the primary stakeholder. The form of capital that is a priority in a COD is human capital, where as the source of capital as a priority in COP is financial. They can be complementary but are not the same and somewhat different so they have to be two complementary but co-existing cultures. Coaching Research Laboratory at CWRU

A Culture of Development to Complement a Culture of Performance: Besides periodic informal conversations about how each other is doing, an activity with the greatest potential for a culture of Develpoment is coaching. To be inclusive and make it accessible, it should include 1-1, team and peer coaching in groups.
