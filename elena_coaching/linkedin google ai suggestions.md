Alright, let's revamp those LinkedIn strategies based on the Rival IQ 2024 LinkedIn Benchmark Report! Key takeaways from the report relevant to our strategy:

*   **Engagement Rate by Follower:** Median brands earn 0.41% engagement rate per follower.
*   **Video Matters:** Video posts generate significantly higher engagement and view rates.
*   **Posting Frequency:** Median brand posts 3.3 times per week. Bigger accounts post more often (5 times per week for 100K+ followers).
*   **Bigger Isn't Always Better:** Smaller, engaged followings outperform larger ones.
*   **Post Type:** Photos are the most frequent, but Document and Collage posts earn HIGH engagement rates (experiment with those!). Video is key, though only 17% of overall content.
*   **Impressions per Follower:** Median brand reaches about 8.63 impressions per 100 followers per post.
*   **Video Views per Impression:** Median brand earns 42 video views per 100 impressions on video posts.
*   **Follower Growth:** Brands grow their followers at least 1% monthly. Smaller accounts grow faster (1.5%).

**Revised LinkedIn Strategies (incorporating the data):**

**General Strategy Adjustments (Applicable to All Segments):**

*   **Increase Video Content:** Prioritize creating short, engaging videos (using Reels, TikTok and YouTube as inspiration).
*   **Experiment with Document/Collage Posts:** Think outside the box and use these less common formats to grab attention. How can you turn a coaching exercise into a "downloadable document"?
*   **Focus on Engagement:** Remember that smaller, engaged followings outperform larger ones. Prioritize quality over quantity of followers.
*   **Target for Reach:** Remember the report notes that the top brands reach 20% of followers with each post.
*   **Regular Posting:** Aim for 3-5 posts per week (adjust based on your follower count; smaller accounts may benefit from fewer, higher-quality posts).
*   **Track Metrics:** Monitor your engagement rate by follower, impressions per follower, and video views per impression to see what's working.

**Segment-Specific Strategies (Revised with Benchmark Data):**

**1. The Technical-to-Leadership Transitioner:**

*   **Video Focus:** Create short videos answering common leadership questions ("How to Delegate Effectively in 60 Seconds").
*   **Experiment with Document Posts:** Create a downloadable PDF checklist: "Top 5 Mistakes New IT Leaders Make (and How to Avoid Them)". Promote that in a high engagement text based post with a good visual.
*   **Call to Action:** "Download my free checklist and start leading with confidence today! [Link]"
*   **Thought Leadership:** Use posts that highlight personal traits and brand awareness.
    *     *Example: "*Brand Name* helps IT Leaders like you delegate with confidence.*"

*   **Long-Term Strategy:**
    *   Build a series of short, actionable videos: Focus on key leadership skills (delegation, communication, feedback, conflict resolution). Offer them one video at a time, via your newsletter.
*   **Why It Works:** This takes advantage of the high engagement of video, while using less frequent post types.

**2. The Overwhelmed Middle Manager:**

*   **Video Focus:** Share quick mindfulness exercises or time management tips in short video format.
*   **Experiment with Collage Posts:** Create a visual collage of stress-relieving techniques (images of nature, breathing exercises, etc.)

*   **Regular Posting:** Post every week, focusing on photos and text.
*   **Call to Action:** "Download my free guide to stress-free IT management [Link]"
*   **Long-Term Strategy:**
    *   Develop a "Stress-Free IT Management" e-book: Offer practical tips for time management, prioritization, delegation, and stress reduction.

**3. The Career Plateaued:**

*   **Video Focus:** Share client success stories (anonymized, of course) in video format ("How I Helped [IT Manager] Land Their Dream Role").
*   **Use LinkedIn articles:** The report notes that photo and articles dominated the engagement charts.
*   **Experiment with Document Posts:** Turn your "Personal Branding Guide" into a visually appealing PDF document.
*   **Call to Action:** "Schedule a free career consultation to get unstuck! [Link]"
*   **Social Proof:** Highlight any awards, certifications, or speaking engagements that demonstrate your expertise in career coaching.
*   **Long-Term Strategy:**
    *   Offer a "Career Pathing Assessment": A quiz or survey that helps them identify their strengths and potential career paths.

**4. The Digital Transformation Leader:**

*   **Video Focus:** Interview other digital transformation leaders, share insights from industry events, or create explainer videos on key digital transformation concepts.
*   **Thought leadership**: Position and highlight successful transformation projects.
*   **Experiment with Collage Posts:** Create a collage visualizing the key steps in a successful digital transformation project.
*   **Call to Action:** "Download my free digital transformation roadmap template [Link]"
*   **Share data**: Make sure to share data and information to your stakeholders.
*   **Long-Term Strategy:**
    *   Host a "Digital Transformation Leadership Forum": A virtual event where they can connect with other leaders and share best practices.
