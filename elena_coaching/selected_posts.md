Are you a helping Bully?
Coaching with compassion is more powerful than coaching for compliance. But we often allow our good intentions and urgency to push us into giving advice, telling others what they should do, and as a result we become helping bullies.

Real Self: In Intentional Change Theory, I claim that the Real Self is the person that others experience and observe. It is not what you think of yourself. The reason is that since Ed Hollander's work in the late 1950's, we know that a person's assessment of their behavior and skills is delusional. Professor Scott Taylor and his colleagues have shown repeatedly in recent years that profound gender differences occur in self-assessment (i.e., professional women are typically under-estimators, professional men are typically over-estimators). This results in self-assessment being less valid for predicting a person's behavior. Self-assessment is useful as a part of coaching (i.e., the person's mental model of themself) and when studying values or attitudes (i.e., internal phenomenon). hashtag#coaching hashtag#humanresourcedevelopment hashtag#leadershipdevelopment hashtag#assessment

Change is difficult. Sustained, desired change is relatively rare given the amount of time and resources spent on it. Part of the challenge is that we don't understand the distribution of human behavior and performance. Actual behavior, performance, and change is seldom distributed on a normal (Gaussian) distribution. It is almost always discontinuous or something closer to a power curve. So what you ask? When we analyze change and assume that the average or mean is meaningful, and that outliers aee to be tossed, and that each moment or occurrence is independent of others, we make foolish mistakes. Read more in: Boyatzis, R.E., & Dhar, Udayan (2023). When normal if not normal: A theory of the  non-linear and discontinuous process of desired change and its managerial implications.

A Culture of Development involves listening to others, focusing on their development desires, dreams, and values (not the organization's). It is a style of conversing which we call coaching with compassion. The contrast is that the Culture of Performance often involves telling as a style, setting and then giving goals and performance expectations to others, or telling others how they have to change to do well. It is a style of conversing which we call Coaching for Compliance. BOTH are needed in organizations. But don't confuse them. They invoke antagonistic neural networks, hormonal systems, and affect in each person. That is why you cannot pursue them the same way. That is, setting performance goals is reasonable. Setting development goals does not help or motivate development -- it actually does the opposite.

A Culture of Development (COD) promotes a dominant value of growth and innovation, while a Culture of Performance (COP) promotes a dominant value of efficiency. In COD growth, learning and adaptation are rewarded. In COP results and output to projections (budgets) are rewarded. The challenge is in enacting these complementary cultures without making one appear to be more important or better than the other. Any ideas?

As we have said in our recent publications, a Culture of Development (COD) focuses on employees or staff as their primary stakeholder. A culture of performance (COP) often focuses on investors or stockholders as the primary stakeholder. The form of capital that is a priority in a COD is human capital, where as the source of capital as a priority in COP is financial. They can be complementary but are not the same and somewhat different so they have to be two complementary but co-existing cultures. Coaching Research Laboratory at CWRU

A Culture of Development to Complement a Culture of Performance: Besides periodic informal conversations about how each other is doing, an activity with the greatest potential for a culture of Develpoment is coaching. To be inclusive and make it accessible, it should include 1-1, team and peer coaching in groups.

A Culture of Development to complement your Culture of Performance: Performance reviews and development reviews are each important. DO NOT do them at the same time- it removes any benefit from either. Everyone is defensive during performance reviews, when salary, bonus or promotions are being discussed. A development discussion requires that a person feels open and safe. In addition to the hormonal systems, the neural networks activated by each of these discussions are antagonistic. Your brain doesn't handle both at the same time. Separate the two reviews and enjoy the increased benefits. We discussed this in our last book and recent seminars.

Renewal alone and with others: Activities that arouse the Parasympathetic Nervous System, according to published medical and psychological research, include things you do alone, like meditate, yoga, and prayer, as well as things you do with others, laugh, help others less fortunate or the elderly (especially elderly professors), and dance. By combining a variety of these activities, you can be stimulating renewal at home, at leisure and at work. And through emotional contagion, your renewal spreads to others.

Coaching with Compassion: Questions that Spark Joy, Gratitude and Curiosity. 
We awaken the desire to change and learn when someone asks us to wonder, ponder and consider. Powerful questions open our minds and hearts. They are an effort to understand others. Most of our questions to others have embedded answers desired. Truly open questions are rare but powerful.

Olivia Newton John sang "let me hear your body talk" in her classic Let's Get Physical. It is the same with somatic awareness. To be clear, renewal is our term for arousal of the Parasympathetic Nervous System. Do not confuse that with relaxation, rest, boredom, or alleviation of stress or discomfort. Merely feeling relieved after removal of stress or pain is less stress, but not renewal. Exhaustion after exercise is not necessarily renewal. When you are in a renewal state, you are or sharing or even infecting others around you with these feelings in microseconds and helping them possibly enter a renewal state!

Somatic awareness of renewal: Most of know what stress feels like but we are often unaware of the sensations that signal renewal. They are: lower pulse rate, lower blood pressure, slower and deeper breathing, and a feeling of elation or peacefulness. Other biomarkers, including neurogenesis, improved immune system functioning, and greater cognitive capacity are internal and difficult to sense. Coaches can help us become aware and reduce confusion with resting, boredom, relaxation, and other related but different states. See our article Boyatzis, R. E., Goleman, D., Dhar, U., & Osiri, J. K. (2021). Thrive and survive: Assessing personal sustainability.

Don't Reduce Stress, Increase Renewal: The science is clear, the only complete antidote to healthy and inspired living and working is to increase the brief (even 10-15 minute episodes) renewal activities.

Beyond Surviving to Thriving: We live lives filled with annoying and acute stress. Attempts to reduce stress are foolish and only lessen the severity of the symptoms and consequences. The only antidote are renewal activities. Technically, these are experiences or activities that activate the Parasympathetic Nervous System.

Creating a Complementary Culture of Development
The engagement crisis, great resignation, quiet quitting and general malaise people feel with their work, jobs and relationship to their bosses is a motivation crisis. Surveys over the last five years have made it clear that for professionals, managers, executives and entrepreneurs, their motivation is driven by their development and novelty at work. People want to grow and develop. Because development is driven by a neural network antagonistic to the task network that drive performance, and we need performance, the solution is to develop a culture of development that complements a culture of performance in our organizations.

Relationships are the Medium: All of our individual characteristics are modified or transformed by the qualities of our relationships. When we have contentious, dissonant or argumentative close relationships, our abilities are constrained. We have less energy and capability to offer to our work, family and community. When we have shared vision/purpose, shared caring for others and shared energy, our relationships amplify our abilities to contribute and help others.

The End of an Era : With the passing of Ed Schein, we are witness to the end of the formative era of organizational development, career development, professional development, and so many fields and sub fields involved in helping humans grow and change. With Warren Bennis passing in 2014, Ed this month, Fritz’s Steele in 2020 and Dave Berlew last year (2022), we see all of the authors of the 1968 landmark book, Interpersonal Dyamics: Essays and Readings on Human Interaction gone. Oddly, each of them were mentors and two among my closest friends. It feels like we continue in our field on the shoulders of giants and hope that’s we can sustain, perpetuate and expand on their insights, sensitivity, and courage.

When it feels like our values are at odds with one another, it helps to remember that values are not goals.

Values are a life direction—they’re aspects of your world that matter to you and that you keep moving toward your best self across the months and years.

Goals, on the other hand, are fixed—they’re achievements you check off a list. Often what we view as a values conflict is really an issue of goal conflict, or of time management, or of the difficulty in committing to a plan or a course of action.

An especially common goal conflict emerges when we try to strike that elusive work-life balance. As mere mortals, we simply cannot be in two places at once. Many of us—myself included—feel like we’re in the middle of a constant tug-of-war between work life and home life.

But what if the choice is not really between work and home? What if the choice is about being fully committed to both rather than conflicted and torn?

Subject: Action Required: Weekly Report on Being a Human at Work

CAUTION: This email originated from within an organization that recognizes people as more than "human capital." Please proceed with authenticity.

Dear Team,

Please reply to this email with approximately 5 bullets on how you contributed not just through output, but through who you are.

Consider including:
 - A moment where you helped someone else succeed.
 - A decision where you prioritized long-term trust over short-term speed.
 - A time when you brought creativity, emotional agility, or collaboration to a challenge.
 - A way in which you made work feel more human—for yourself or someone else.
 - Something you learned that made you better, not just busier.

Please do not send jargon, empty metrics, or proof of working 100-hour weeks. These are not valid indicators of impact.

Deadline: Whenever this reflection is most meaningful for you.

Thank you for bringing your self to work. The best workplaces don’t just measure what you do—they recognize who you are.

With courage, curiosity, and actual humanity,
[Your Manager]

The quality of our lives depends not on how many difficult emotions we experience, or even their intensity, but on the way we deal with them.

We’re sure to meet many difficult emotions in the workplace—anxiety, jealousy, irritation, disappointment—and when we judge ourselves for having them, we often try to push them aside. Suppressed emotions don’t just go away, though: they show up in burnout, low engagement, culture problems, and more. 

When we give ourselves permission to feel our difficult emotions instead, we can show up to them with curiosity and compassion. They can help us find a way forward. 

Is there an emotion that often leads to judgment for you? The next time you feel it come up, see if you can give it permission to just be.

Everyone is talking about the AI Revolution. But the real revolution? The Human Skills Revolution.
As industries transform and jobs are reshaped—or replaced—our edge won’t be knowledge or expertise. It will be the capacities that make us human:

Adaptability
Collaboration
Curiosity
Flexibility
Courage
Sensemaking

These emotional agility capacities will define success—not just at work, but in life. They will keep us psychologically strong and prepared for an unknowable future.

The real question isn’t: What can AI do?
The real question is: What are humans for?
And the answer isn’t knowledge.

It’s human capacities that will shape the future. Get ready.

The next time you’re feeling hesitant to take a risk, ask yourself, “Am I uncomfortable because this isn’t the right path for me, or am I uncomfortable because this is unfamiliar, and I’m growing?”

You might be dreading your first day in a new role at work, but that doesn’t mean you should back out—rather, it may just be a natural reaction to stepping into unfamiliar territory. 

Sometimes simply acknowledging and naming our discomfort in the face of growth is enough to give us the confidence we need to keep going.

Becoming emotionally agile takes time, persistence, and hard work. And while it may not be as easy as repainting your bedroom or buying a new rug, it WILL give you that same "fresh start" feeling. 

You'll approach obstacles with greater clarity and treat those around you with more compassion. You'll know where you'd like to go in life and understand the first steps that will lead you there. Start now.

We often default to sorting the world into categories—it’s just part of our mind’s attempt at making sense of things. But we can rely on labels too heavily. They can sometimes become a crutch, holding us back from our true potential; other times they can imprison us in a limited perspective. 

Even our job titles can become unhelpful labels when we begin to associate too closely with them. Your role may be defined a certain way, but your skills and potential exist beyond the bounds of your role. What opportunities do you choose to explore (or not) based on the way you see yourself at work? 

Consider how you use labels to understand the world around you and invite an agile mindset whenever possible.

The way we navigate our inner worlds is the single most important determinant of our success, yet it’s something we all struggle with.

You face a major setback after months of moving an essential project forward at work. You receive a note from a teacher saying your child has bullied another student at school. A friend cancels their plans to help you move at the last minute, throwing your day into chaos and leaving you feeling unsupported.

How do we handle life’s curveballs with grace, kindness, respect—in short, agility? Read the book to find out. 😉

You can access a free chapter from Emotional Agility or purchase your copy here: https://lnkd.in/eYS3Yz2a

By simply paying attention—on purpose and without judgment—we’re able to fully inhabit the present moment and respond to our circumstances with intention.

Of course, practicing mindfulness in our fast-paced, technologically advanced world is easier said than done, especially when it takes much less effort to act without thought. But moving through the world on autopilot lacks the nuance, depth, and freedom of choice that enables us to truly shape our lives. 

If you want to break free from these automatic responses and cultivate emotional agility, sign up for my waitlist to be notified when new Learning Journeys are available. Emotional Agility Learning Journeys are a roadmap for real behavioral change, guiding you toward more intentional living.

Authenticity is often misunderstood.

Leaders may shy away from it, thinking that authenticity invites others to operate with impunity.

But being authentic doesn't equate to lashing out or acting up. On the contrary, when we're authentic, we show up to our emotions, realize that they contain essential information about our values, and take values-aligned actions.

To cultivate authenticity on your team, try checking in with yourself and the people around you on a regular basis. Notice if you’re speaking honestly or posturing. Ask others how they’re doing and encourage them to speak honestly as well. Notice whether you’re making space for real emotions or creating an expectation of false positivity.

A difficult moment strikes again—a disheartening news story, a confusing work project, a four-year-old who's suddenly turned into a harsh food critic at the dinner table. It's in the midst of these situations that we get the opportunity to choose who we want to be. 

Next time you have the urge to shut down, procrastinate, or have an outburst, find the space to observe your emotions without judgment so that you can act according to your values. Then ask yourself, “Even in the midst of this challenge, who do I choose to be?”

If you want to use questions like this one to empower yourself and help teams navigate uncertainty with confidence, sign up for my waitlist. I have some exciting things planned for this year!

EdTech in organizations is built on a fiction: knowing is the same as doing.

Content libraries overflow with generic information on empathy, difficult conversations, collaboration, trust, and more. But information—even combined with high motivation—does not build real human skills or drive action.

For EdTech to deliver on its promise, it must be designed from the ground up with a deep understanding of how people develop and apply human skills in the real world.

The real opportunity? Bridging the gap between knowledge and lasting behavior change.

If you’re overly focused on the outcome, your vision can start to feel restrained and rigid, and you may struggle to produce the results you want. 

By contrast, when you immerse yourself in the process, you’re much more likely to learn, grow, and grant yourself the freedom to explore in a creative way—a recipe for innovation and problem-solving. 

Think of a challenging situation you’re facing or a project you’re working on. What is the next right move?

Your values, goals, and dreams are as unique to you as your fingerprint.

Don’t make the mistake of chasing a life that isn’t right for you just because it’s been promoted by society, people on social media, or those in your community. Take the time to look inward—rather than outward—when it comes to identifying the path that’s right for you.

Do others' opinions about what is important or right frequently impact your choices? 

When we connect to our real selves and make decisions based on what we believe to be important, rather than being led by others telling us what is right or wrong, important or cool, we have the power to face almost any circumstance in a constructive way. 

Rather than being caught up in pretending or social comparison, we can stride forward with confidence and begin to live our lives without as many regrets and without as much second-guessing.

One word makes a big difference when it comes to talking about our emotions. 

If you can shift from saying, “I am worried,” to, “I am feeling worried,” you separate yourself from your emotion. This is a beautiful, subtle reminder that you are not your emotions—they are a part of your experience, but they don’t define you.

How could we change our approach to wellbeing in the workplace? We could begin by sharing responsibility. Just as the health of the organization depends on the people who work there, the health and wellness of each individual also depends on the organization itself. 

Let’s be brave enough to acknowledge when systems aren’t working and need to evolve. Let’s be brave enough to support each other and ourselves on our mental health journeys.

Everyone is talking about the AI Revolution.
But the real revolution? The Human Skills Revolution.
As industries transform and jobs are reshaped—or replaced—our edge won’t be knowledge or expertise. It will be the capacities that make us human:
🔹 Adaptability
🔹 Collaboration
🔹 Curiosity
🔹 Flexibility
🔹 Courage
🔹 Sensemaking
These emotional agility capacities will define success—not just at work, but in life. They will keep us psychologically strong and prepared for an unknowable future.

The real question isn’t: What can AI do?
The real question is: What are humans for?
And the answer isn’t knowledge.

It’s human capacities that will shape the future. Get ready.

It can be really scary to let go. 

So scary, in fact, that our fear often becomes a barrier for us, and we cling more tightly. But we’ll never get to the “next thing”—whether that entails a new job opportunity, relationship, or city we’d like to explore—by clinging to what we already have. 

Even if you can’t let go today, see if you can hold lightly—this means taking a big step back, finding a new perspective, acknowledging that you can’t control everything about a situation, and choosing not to take yourself or others too seriously. Change is a process, not an event.

It's hard to maintain a sense of calm when you're juggling a deadline at work, a weekly calendar full of meetings, and ongoing family responsibilities. 

If your emotions are threatening to send you over the edge, try to identify exactly what you're feeling.

Stress is different from anxiety and anger is different from frustration.

Correctly labeling your emotion is the first step to achieving greater balance.

We make plenty of small choices every day without giving them much thought, but in reality, they add up. A single choice repeated over a matter of days, then months, then years, could actually alter the course of your life.

If you value your relationships but often find yourself prioritizing other parts of your life over quality time with your partner, it may be time to reevaluate that. If you value collaboration but often find yourself speaking over your coworkers during meetings, you may want to focus on listening more in your next meeting.

If you or someone you know is experiencing grief right now, allow for the space to just “be.” 

Don’t try to find a silver lining, pretend it isn’t happening, or fast forward through the discomfort. Meet the situation with gentle acceptance: “This is painful. It will take time to heal. I’m here for you.”

There's always that one thing that hooks you, whether it's a colleague's condescending tone, a tedious project you just can't seem to complete, or a meeting that feels like it's dragging on forever.

Whatever it is, learn to notice when you're hooked so you can speak to yourself kindly, notice what important messages your difficult emotions contain, and create space between stimulus and response.

Perhaps there's simply no way out of that three-hour meeting, but at the very least you can regulate your frustration so you don't make it more painful than it already is.

In my upcoming Learning Journeys, we’ll explore how to empower yourself and others to meet our most challenging moments with a whole-person approach. Whether your focus is on wellbeing in the workplace, human-centered leadership, navigating change, or coaching and guiding others, I’m excited to share what we have in store for this year to fit your needs.

Authenticity, psychological safety, and open dialogue all begin with individuals who are willing to take risks. Culture change can be scary, but if we can commit to taking small steps toward a more open and honest culture (and support each other in doing so) we begin to free our organizations from the limiting perspectives and systems that hold them back.

If you make too many mindless, autopilot decisions, eventually you’ll find yourself living what feels like somebody else’s life—a life aligned with values you don’t necessarily ascribe to. 

Society sends us strong messaging about what “successful” professions, partnerships, homes, habits, bodies, and family lives should look like. But the person who knows best what your most fulfilling life looks like is YOU. 

Take the time to figure out what your values are so they can guide you toward a future that’s joyful, purposeful, and unique to you alone.

Experiences of sadness, anger, guilt, or fear can help us form arguments, improve memory, encourage perseverance, make us more polite and attentive, encourage generosity, and make us less prone to confirmation bias. 

Take the time to correctly label your emotions and learn from them instead of pushing them aside.

Have you ever wondered if the small actions you take actually have any impact on your life?

On a sailboat, even a shift of a degree or two can change where you wind up across the bay. Imagine how much greater that effect would be if you were sailing across the ocean.

When people take a small values-aligned action, it predicts the likelihood that in the following week they will also act in ways that are values-aligned. Imagine the small, values-based changes you make are the degrees of a sailing destination and the ocean is the path of your future. Where you end up depends on how you adjust your coordinates, one choice at a time. If you want to change your life, start small.

The research: “Increasing prosocial behavior and decreasing selfishness in the lab and everyday life” (Gloster, Rinner, & Meyer)

If you tell yourself a particular story for long enough, you might start to believe it. 

This isn’t always a good thing. In other words, if you tell yourself a story about how you lack certain skills or qualities, you can create an internal bias that works against your chances of success. 

Maybe you bombed an interview years ago and the belief that you’re “terrible at interviewing” has replayed in your head ever since. This old, outdated story could thwart your chances of acing the interview process in order to land your dream job—and all because of something that happened a decade ago! What outdated stories are you holding on to? Let those go.

Tough emotions are not negative. They are normal.

There is a significant cost to the cultural view that these normal emotions are bad. For example, when we experience a difficult emotion at work, our impulse is often to suppress it. 

But an emotionally honest workplace is an agile workplace. The (sometimes terrifying) work of showing up to your emotions can create a ripple effect throughout your organization. The vulnerability of one person paves the way for the vulnerability of another. 

Create a culture of psychological safety so that your people feel seen, heard, and valued as human beings.

We can spend so much of our time rushing from one thing to the next that being mindful feels like an impossible achievement, reserved for social media influencers and those with unlimited time and resources.

But contrary to what you might see online—blissful poolside yoga classes and remote island meditation retreats—mindfulness is something that happens during the rushing around, not outside of it. We can be mindful at any moment, and it usually doesn’t look glamorous at all: shuttling kids to band practice, vacuuming cat hair off of the rug, scrambling to finish a project for a deadline. 

Mindfulness can happen wherever you are and while you're doing whatever you’re doing. It’s about staying connected to your life as it is right now, rather than getting lost in the “what ifs, I wish I hads,” and dreaming about lost opportunities that you could be living. 

Try to find specific times throughout the day when you fully inhabit the moment you’re in, connecting with both yourself and those around you. The “there” will lose its power over you when you’re truly “here.”

People who can identify the full spectrum of emotion—for example, those who realize how sadness differs from boredom, or pity, or loneliness, or nervousness—do much, much better at managing the ups and downs of ordinary existence than those who see everything in a limited binary.

Do you know the differences between sympathy, empathy, and compassion?

The psychological hallmark of empathy is perspective-taking, the capacity to imagine or take the perspective of another person. When you are empathizing, you imagine how someone may feel even though you can’t experience their exact emotion.

While these statements are not meant to be used as a script, they can help us cultivate an awareness of how best to support those around us.

When we move from sympathy to empathy to compassion, we bring action to our intention. Instead of standing across from the person in pain, we stand with them.

We often view quitting as a sign of weakness and value grit over everything else. But the reality is that perseverance, like so many other things, is an ingredient best used in moderation. In order to develop true resilience, we need to know when to grit and when to quit.

Be honest with yourself when a project isn’t coming together right or an approach you thought was foolproof fails to solve the problem at hand. In scenarios like this, agility can be far more valuable than stubbornly sticking to the original plan.

We often have an idea of success as being far more glamorous than it actually is, but dreams are built one step at a time. When we only see the final result, we don’t get much insight into the entire process that came before.

Emotional Agility is out in the world now, but what did it take to get to that point? Long before I ever got to hold a published copy of the book in my hands, I was sitting inside while on vacation with my family, editing a draft of it. My publishers had sent it to me two days prior. And so while everyone else was relaxing at the beach, I was busy working. Beyond this moment, there had been countless other days in libraries and coffee shops. It was a lot of work. And it was worth it. 

Today, I just wanted to share this moment with all of you to remind you that long term goals don’t happen overnight. Don’t forget to check in with yourself once in a while and remind yourself why you're doing what you're doing and why it's important. It will keep you moving toward your final destination, whatever that may happen to be.

We’re so often encouraged to inhabit the future and the past—the five year plan, learning from past experiences, and so on. There’s less conversation surrounding the immediate present. 

What if where we are, right now, is enough? If we can learn to approach the present moment from a mindset of stability rather than scarcity, we’ll be one step closer to contentment. What’s working for you today?

Who do you want to be?

It's not always easy to know the answer to this question, and sometimes it takes time (and some trial and error) to figure it out. But once you do, it will be a whole lot easier to act in accordance with your values, and your life will become more purposeful and satisfying. 

Notice which activities make you feel the most alive and which often lead to disengagement. The more self-discovery you make time for, the closer you will be to creating a life that’s truly fulfilling.

The ability to be agile with our emotions doesn’t only affect us. It changes our relationships by enabling us to be more mindful in our interactions with those we care about most. When we show up to our emotions with more curiosity and compassion, we set an example for others, as well. 

Moments make movements. Let’s create a world where we can embrace our humanity together. 

To get started with better understanding how you can be with your emotions effectively, take my 5-minute Emotional Agility Quiz, and you’ll receive a free, personalized report as a follow up. https://lnkd.in/euyuGzi6

We all have hundreds of small opportunities to act courageously each day. 

We might smile at someone we love, choosing connection rather than holding onto anger; use our voice from a place of wisdom and calm rather than powerless silence or raging expression; or say no to a habit that doesn't nurture our body or mind. 

By taking steps both big and small, we find the courage to invite values-driven actions into our lives.

We’ve all heard it before: it’s about the journey, not the destination. But what does this look like when we have a specific goal we’re trying to achieve? 

When we’re really engaged in a task that fascinates us, our brain often enters a state of “creative flow.” During this state, we might lose track of time or fail to hear what someone says to us. This is the experience of making music, rather than performing for applause. 

It can be difficult to enter this space of innovation and creativity when we’re overly focused on what others will think of the end result. So free yourself. Let go of your attachment to the finished product and embrace the process instead.

Transform "have-to" goals into "want-go" goals. 

Have-to goals are imposed on us, perhaps by a friend, partner, boss, or even our own sense of obligation. When we pursue them, we’re usually driven by a desire to avoid shame and keep up appearances.

Want-to goals, on the other hand, reflect a person’s genuine interests and values. We pursue these kinds of goals because of personal enjoyment, the inherent importance of the goal, or because the goal has been assimilated into our core identity.

So how do you transform a have-to goal into a want-to? By asking yourself why you want to do something—why this truly matters—and connecting to it on your own terms and through your own values rather than those foisted on you from the outside.

We’ll all be on the lookout for ghouls and goblins today, but sometimes the scariest creature we have to confront actually resides within each of us. Whether it’s shame, anger, fear, resentment, or any number of other difficult emotions, we all have some part of our inner landscape that we’d just rather avoid. And sometimes we avoid it for so long, our fear compounds, making a mountain out of a molehill, or a cavern out of a cranny.

So let’s go exploring this spooky season. Let’s be brave enough to brush the cobwebs out of our eyes and venture further down those shadowy paths we usually prefer to ignore. When we shine the light of compassion and gentle acceptance on our deepest and darkest pain, fear, or suffering, we’re taking the first step toward healing.

What’s one emotion you wanted to ignore recently that you chose to turn toward instead?

Stress happens. 

You don't need to eliminate it to enjoy your career or live a fulfilling life—quite the contrary. Stress is part of the full spectrum of emotion. It is a natural response to the world around us. Rather than fighting it, we can ride the waves of it, integrating it into our response to the world.

How do we navigate a world of uncertainty and impermanence? From a values-connected foundation. 

We can't hold on to anything forever, but we can enjoy it while it lasts. This realization can be incredibly painful at times, such as when we have to say goodbye to someone we love or miss out on an opportunity we truly wanted. But loss opens the door to growth. Trust the process.

Got a tough conversation ahead of you? Emotions are the key driver of whether a conversation is effective—or not.

If you're finding it difficult to approach a tough conversation, you’re not the only one. Managing the emotional tone of a conversation is hard. These questions can help. They can be used with a friend, a family member, or to think through a conversation you need to have with your team.

Despite its far-reaching impact, the psychological skill set that aids our wellbeing is rarely addressed or prioritized. Human skills have been cast aside as “soft.” But they aren't "soft." They drive everything; they are learnable, practical, and powerful.

Even in the face of this challenge, who do I choose to be? 

Life presents us with this question over and over again. It's a gift, really—this opportunity that renews itself, a chance to redefine ourselves with each new hurdle. After all, our growth comes not through denying or suppressing difficult emotions, but by engaging with them, learning from them, and using them as a source of inspiration in our lives.

Emotional agility is the application of all our wisdom, compassion, and courage in the trying moments that test us the most.

If you want to learn how to better engage with your emotions in the workplace and at home, join me for Emotional Agility for Wellbeing at Work. This is the LAST WEEKEND to register!

Learning to accept all our emotions—even the uncomfortable ones—is essential to our wellbeing. 

For the past few decades, I've challenged the narrative that emotions like happiness are "good" while others, like sadness or anger, are "bad." Categorizing emotions by whether they are "positive" or "negative" has been the norm. It's rare to come across academic literature in psychology that doesn't use these terms, but this approach actually costs us.

And if you're interested in free, actionable tools make sure you're signed up for my newsletter here: https://lnkd.in/ej_nSHP 📣

In my upcoming learning journey, Emotional Agility for Wellbeing at Work, we will explore how we can move toward the gentle acceptance of all of our emotions and how this can guide us toward a deeper understanding of ourselves and our needs. Learn more and secure your spot before doors close tomorrow, Friday October 18th!

Sometimes we get stuck. We think we’re in a stalemate when we’re actually in a season.

Seasons pass.

Seasons need self-compassion. They need a heart turned to the fluidity of life and learning.

There is a tomorrow, waiting for your fierceness.

But today, be.

Nobody is perfect. 

When you or your colleagues make a mistake, do you respond with compassion? Or do you fall into negative dialogue patterns of shame and blame?

Shame urges you to look at yourself not as a human being who did a bad thing, but as a human being who is fundamentally bad. It shuts out any chance of transformation or change, leaving the individual stuck in a reactive place with a negative self-image.

Guilt, on the other hand, is action-based. It allows you to separate yourself from the action that was bad. You can feel regret, acknowledge that you would like to do better, and move forward having learned a valuable lesson. In doing so, you tap into your potential for growth. 

Learn to lead and work from a place of compassion. Your team, your organization, and your professional relationships will improve as a result.

Organizations are experiencing extraordinary levels of complexity, and it's people who are paying the price. Harvard Business Review reports that wellbeing has declined for 85 percent of employees. Emotional Agility for Wellbeing at Work is designed to address this need—to boost wellbeing, decrease stress and burnout, and enable people to thrive. 

My upcoming open-enrollment opportunity is for working professionals, coaches, business owners, leaders, entrepreneurs—anyone who is burning the candle at both ends and looking for a foundational human skillset to help keep pace with the rapidly evolving world of work.

Organizations are increasingly recognizing that wellbeing is not a nice-to-have. It's integral to a healthy organization. Wellbeing is everyone's business, and the time for emotional agility is now.

🚨Doors will close this week on October 18th. Don't miss out! 🚨 Reserve your spot today.

Many of us reflexively judge our normal, natural emotions. 

We might examine whether we have the right to feel the way we do or judge ourselves based on what we think someone in our position should feel. We even have expectations about how many emotions we should feel at a given moment, often imagining that our emotions will be straightforward and singular at certain times.

But it’s normal to have mixed feelings. 

Give yourself the space to be a messy, capacious human. You are capable of feeling both hopeful for a good outcome and anxious about how the project will turn out, joy for a friend leaving your company and disappointment that you will no longer see them as often. Emotional complexity is purposeful, beautiful, and human.

BREAKING: It’s World Mental Health Day, which means it’s time for a reality check. Are we doing the best we can to support ourselves and those around us? What could we do better? 

One of the first things that comes to mind is the health of our organizations, communities, and workplaces. For too long, wellbeing at work was considered a nicety, an aside—in other words, if you worked at a place that valued individual wellbeing, you were lucky. 

But the conversation is starting to shift. We’re realizing that wellbeing isn’t a benefit—it’s a necessity. Our organizations are inextricably linked with our humanity. And because we’re human, our wellbeing impacts everything, from culture to engagement, innovation to leadership. We are human first. Let’s honor that today and every day. 

Give yourself—or your team—the gift of wellbeing today by enrolling in my upcoming learning journey, Emotional Agility for Wellbeing at Work. It’s the perfect way to reset, reconnect with those around you, and open important conversations in ways that are authentic, grounded, and beneficial to both your organization and the people who work there.

Self-compassion is especially important when you're going through a challenging time.

You may say something unkind, but that doesn't mean you're a bad person. You may not get the job, but that doesn't mean your skills are unmarketable. You may not run a meeting efficiently, but that doesn't mean you're incapable of managing a team. 

How do you bring compassion to your workplace for both yourself and those around you?

The world is changing rapidly. We are increasingly caught between organizational demands and environmental realities. Yet at the same time, this complexity conspires against positive change, leading to rigidity, poorer relationships, and lower wellbeing. The demand for people and organizations to be agile has never been greater.

Emotional Agility Learning Journeys are designed to address this need. Beginning in October, Emotional Agility for Wellbeing at Work is designed to boost wellbeing, build resilience, and offer foundational skills for navigating the emotional complexities of modern work. There will be two live sessions with me, self-paced interactive lessons, beautifully mastered videos, targeted reflection questions, and actionable commitments. It’s specifically designed to help working professionals create real impact and change in just a few minutes a day.

Sometimes it’s not specific complexities or uncertainties that lead to organizational fragility—it’s the way we respond to those situations.

When a situation feels overwhelmingly complex, we often default to rigid responses, such as:
-labeling others (“He’s a narcissist.”)
-binary thinking (“You’re either with me or against me.”)
-siloed thinking (failing to consider the effects of choices on other departments)
-wrongheaded righteousness (getting stuck on one perspective)

As leaders, managers, colleagues, and community members, it’s absolutely essential that we become aware of rigid thinking. Ask, “What aren’t we seeing here?” When we elevate our curiosity, we widen the circle of possibility rather than shrinking it. We become agile.

This hectic, constantly changing world is asking so much of us. We must lead in the midst of uncertainty, evolve to keep pace with technological innovation, and manage our busy lives as professionals, colleagues, and caregivers. We often wish we had a life raft to help us stay afloat (and on our worst days, even a piece of driftwood would suffice).

If you’re looking for a way to improve your sense of wellbeing at work, reduce stress and burnout, and just reset, join me this October for Emotional Agility for Wellbeing at Work. It’s a 3-week transformative journey that includes two virtual live sessions with me and a collection of short, easily-digestible interactive content focused on learnable, actionable human skills. It’s a differentiated experience designed to create real impact and deep change in just a few minutes a day.

Sometimes, we know we’re growing: we can choose to practice a new skill, try a new approach, or respond in a different way. We may choose to change parts of our lives, from switching careers to trying to cook healthier meals. That type of growth is challenging in its own right, but we can often grow during periods of challenge too.

A difficult boss requires you to manage up, technology advances in your field require that you evolve, an economic downturn forces you to somehow do more with less: hard, uncomfortable situations can prompt our growth in a myriad of ways. 

We meet challenging times with the best of ourselves when we intentionally choose to grow, giving ourselves space to learn, practice, and make adjustments as we go. I teach key skills for this kind of growth in Emotional Agility for Wellbeing at Work, a learning journey beginning this October. Learn more and register to join me here. https://lnkd.in/eAU4JNNc

Courage can be loud.

It might look like running your first marathon, participating in a protest, or saying yes to something unfamiliar. 

But mostly, courage is a whisper: those moments every day when you do what’s right for you—lacing up your running sneakers after recovering from an injury, having a respectful disagreement about something you value, or saying no to a behavior that no longer serves you. By taking steps both big and small, we find the courage to invite values-driven actions into our lives.

Spots are filling up fast. Write ENROLL in the comments, and I’ll send you a link to reserve your spot before we sell out.

Emotional Agility for Wellbeing at Work is for working professionals, coaches, business owners, leaders, entrepreneurs, and anyone who wants to boost wellbeing, reduce stress and burnout, maintain motivation, and keep pace with the rapidly evolving world of work. 

This unique experience is designed to create real impact and deep change in just a few minutes of learning a day, and I’m excited to share what we have planned:

- A virtual live keynote Kickoff with me on October 30th and a virtual live Ask Me Anything session on November 20th. There will be a choice of two time options for each session, and they will also be recorded for those who cannot attend live.
- 15 exclusive, self-paced microskills: These powerful, bite-sized packages of interactive content focus on developing essential emotional agility skills and will be delivered right to your inbox over the course of three weeks. 

You've been asking for new ways to bring emotional agility into your lives for a long time now, and my team and I could not be more thrilled to share this with you. I look forward to seeing you there.

We often think that thriving means living a life of success, pleasure, and ease, but true thriving is less about the outcomes of our lives, and more about how we each approach our unique set of challenges, opportunities, and goals. 

You can still thrive even in the face of setbacks, difficult relationships, or while feeling stuck in a role that isn’t quite your dream job. Tough situations and the tough emotions that often accompany them are an unavoidable part of life. 

When we turn to our difficult emotions as sources of insight, we’re able to tap into our values, make intentional decisions, and live authentically. 

We don’t just thrive despite difficult emotions, we often thrive because of them. We learn how to build rich, fulfilling lives by engaging with our emotions from a place of curiosity, compassion, and agility.

When we’re feeling burned out or having a tough time, we often become overly focused on reaching the light at the end of the metaphorical tunnel. 

In these moments, it’s all too easy to look forward to some indefinite point in the future when work will slow down or when we’ll suddenly feel well and happy. But by being with what is, we can learn how to thrive within the reality of our present. We can stop treating ourselves like inexhaustible machines and instead lean in to our humanity.

If you feel like you’re traveling through one of these tunnels right now, you’re not alone. In fact, I’ve received hundreds of requests from people looking to integrate emotional agility more deeply and sustainably into their lives, which is why I’m thrilled to invite you to Emotional Agility for Wellbeing at Work. It’s a three-week online learning opportunity designed to create real impact and change in just a few minutes a day. Together, we’re going to boost resilience, reduce stress and burnout, forge positive cultural change, and learn how to see in the dark. 

Spots are limited! Enroll now: https://lnkd.in/eAU4JNNc

What does your inner dialogue sound like when anxiety rears its head? The way we talk about our emotions matters. 

Rather than saying, “I am anxious,” (which suggests that being anxious is who you are), try saying, “I am feeling anxious.” This simple language trick creates the critical space you need to process tough emotions in a healthy way.

You might think you’re in control of unwanted emotions when you ignore them, but they control you.

Internal pain always comes out—always. The best way to cope with amplification is to sit with your emotions. Giving yourself a small moment of reflection to process a tough emotion can improve your relationships and your day to day experience as a whole. Try to really see yourself in that moment.

Ask, how can I best support myself in this moment? What do I need? The answers to these questions could be as simple as taking a few deep breaths, placing your hands over your heart or belly, going for a short walk, or making a cup of tea.

In my TED Conferences talk, I talk about the effects of ignoring or suppressing our emotions and where we go from here. Watch it at the link in my bio.

When you find yourself shrinking away from something, ask yourself: Is this behavior preventing me from being the best version of myself, or is it supporting that version of me?

You can revisit these questions time and time again, because your answers will likely vary depending on your time of life or the surrounding circumstances. The key is to see yourself as capable of change and to trust that you will know when change is necessary for you.

Forcing positivity in a negative situation is not leadership. It's denial.

Hope and optimism are different from (forced) positivity. They are future-oriented and earned by a willingness to work hard and problem-solve to create a better outcome.

Don’t shrink from the hard conversations. Don’t insist that everyone hide their true feelings behind a smiling veneer. Instead, recognize difficult feelings as signposts that point to real issues and encourage emotional honesty.

No one ever achieved anything of worth without some setbacks and challenges along the way. 

Emotional agility is about facing these moments with clarity, self-compassion, and curiosity. 

You're human. You're going to experience stress and anxiety, you're going to have moments when you say the wrong thing, and you're going to make mistakes. But you'll learn from these moments and end up becoming a better person as a result. 

Don't waste your time avoiding or suppressing your difficult emotions—open yourself up to the full experience of this life.

A “good” leader, we’ve been told, should be stoic and certain, rarely expressing their feelings or admitting doubts. But when our natural human responses to the trials and travails of work are recast as less than or weakness, it is to the detriment of all involved.

Employees aren’t robots and will eventually burn out if treated this way. 🤖Our real-world experience at work actually shows that those who model caring, authentic, and emotionally skilled behaviors are far more effective than those who don’t.

If you want to address these dynamics and begin dismantling display rules in the workplace, join me for Emotional Agility for Wellbeing at Work, designed to boost wellbeing, increase resilience, and reduce stress and burnout. Space is limited and will sell out. Comment REGISTER and I’ll send you the link to learn more and reserve your spot (or a spot for your team) today!

When we move through the world on autopilot, we can fail to realize the small ways we can contribute to the world: taking on an extra household chore to help a spouse who’s anxious about a work deadline, or calling a lonely friend who just moved to a new city. 

These simple gestures may not feel heroic, but a balanced capacity for compassion doesn’t require us to be heroes. It just asks us to be aware of what we can do for others while still honoring what we need to do for ourselves.
