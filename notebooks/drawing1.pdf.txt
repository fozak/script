THE FOLLOWING GENERAL NOTES APPLY TO ALL 
ARCHITECTURAL SERIES SHEETS.  FOR GENERAL NOTES 
APPLICABLE TO ALL SHEETS REFER TO THE "PROJECT 
GENERAL NOTES":
A. 
THE ARCHITECTURAL SERIES SHEETS ARE PART OF A 
COMPLETE SET OF CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS 
DESCRIBING THE WORK FOR THIS PROJECT. USERS OF 
THESE DOCUMENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE TO REVIEW ALL 
CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS TO UNDERSTAND AND 
COORDINATE THE GRAPHIC AND ANNOTATED 
INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THESE ARCHITECTURAL 
SERIES SHEETS.
B. 
EXCEPT WHERE DIRECTED TO PLACE ITEMS OF WORK AT 
THE APPROXIMATE LOCATIONS SHOWN, DO NOT SCALE 
DRAWINGS FOR DIMENSIONAL INFORMATION.  ALL 
ELEMENTS OF THE DRAWINGS MAY NOT BE DRAWN TO 
EXACT SCALE.  ALL DIMENSIONS REQUIRED ARE SHOWN 
OR MAY BE DERIVED FROM THOSE SHOWN ON THE FLOOR 
PLANS, DETAIL PLANS, ELEVATIONS, SECTIONS, DETAILS, 
SCHEDULES, AND SPECIFICATIONS.
C. 
ALL VISUALLY EXPOSED STRUCTURAL, MECHANICAL AND 
ELECTRICAL ELEMENTS, INCLUDING EXPOSED METAL 
FLOOR AND ROOF DECK, ARE TO BE PAINTED UNLESS 
OTHERWISE NOTED. THIS INCLUDES ELEMENTS THAT MAY 
BE VISIBLE THROUGH GRILLES, LOUVERS OR CEILINGS. 
COLORS AND PAINT MATERIALS ARE DEFINED IN THE 
FINISH SCHEDULE, THE SPECIFICATIONS, AND THE 
DRAWINGS AS APPLICABLE TO THE CONSTRUCTION 
DOCUMENTS.
A. 
THE PURPOSE OF THIS SHEET IS TO ILLUSTRATE AND 
DEFINE TYPICAL GRAPHIC SYMBOLS WHICH MAY 
TYPICALLY OCCUR ON THE ARCHITECTURAL DRAWINGS.
B. 
ADDITIONAL SYMBOLS NOT SHOWN OR DEFINED ON THIS 
SHEET MAY BE USED ON THE ARCHITECTURAL 
DRAWINGS AND ARE TYPICALLY DEFINED ON OTHER 
SHEETS.
C. 
SYMBOLS ARE NOT DRAWN TO SCALE. TO DETERMINE 
THE ACTUAL SIZES OF ELEMENTS REPRESENTED BY 
SYMBOLS, REFER TO THE SPECIFICATIONS AND OTHER 
SHEETS, AS MAY APPLY.
A. 
THE TERM "REFERENCE" ELEVATION OR DIMENSIONS 
REFERS TO A NOMINAL WORK POINT.  THE ACTUAL 
ELEVATION MAY VARY FROM THE REFERENCE POINT.  
REFER TO APPLICABLE DETAIL TO DETERMINE THE 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE ACTUAL ELEVATION OR 
DIMENSION AND THE STATED REFERENCE POINT."
B. 
THE DESIGN REFERENCE ELEVATION +0'-0" SHOWN ON THE 
ARCHITECTURAL DRAWINGS CORRESPONDS TO THE FINISH 
FLOOR ELEVATION OF THE GROUND FLOOR.  ESTABLISH 
THE ACTUAL ELEVATION WITH RESPECT TO SITE-SPECIFIC 
BENCHMARKS AND CONTROL POINTS AS DEFINED IN THE 
CIVIL DRAWINGS.
C. 
"FINISH FLOOR" ELEVATIONS ARE MEASURED AT THE TOP 
OF THE CONCRETE FLOOR SLAB UNLESS OTHERWISE 
NOTED.  APPLIED FINISHES SUCH AS RESILIENT FLOORING 
OR CARPET MAY RAISE THE ACTUAL FINISH SURFACE 
ABOVE THE REFERENCE ELEVATION PROVIDED FOR THE 
FINISH FLOOR.
D. 
WHERE CONCRETE FLOOR SLAB IS DEPRESSED TO 
ACCOMMODATE MORTAR BEDS, SETTING BEDS, RAISED 
ACCESS FLOORS, AND OTHER SIMILAR FLOOR 
ASSEMBLIES,  "FINISHED FLOOR" ELEVATIONS ARE 
MEASURED AS IF CONCRETE DEPRESSION DOES NOT 
OCCUR.
E. 
CEILING HEIGHT ELEVATIONS ARE MEASURED TO BOTTOM 
OF FINISH SURFACES AND STATED IN RELATION TO 
DISTANCE ABOVE THE REFERENCE ELEVATION FOR THE 
FINISH FLOOR UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.
F. 
ROOF ELEVATIONS ARE MEASURED TO TOP OF SURFACES 
AND STATED IN RELATION TO DISTANCE ABOVE THE 
REFERENCE ELEVATION  PROVIDED FOR THE UPPERMOST 
FINISH FLOOR UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.  ELEVATIONS 
GIVEN ARE TO TOP OF STEEL (TOS), TOP OF DECK (TOD), 
OR TOP OF TAPERED INSULATION (TOT) UNLESS 
OTHERWISE NOTED.

TAG (POINT TAG): UNIQUE SENSOR/DEVICE IDENTIFICATION DESIGNATION.
AI (ANALOG INPUT):A SIGNAL INPUT TO THE BUILDING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WHICH HAS A VARIABLE RANGE OF VALUES. ANALOG INPUTS PROVIDE NUMERIC DATA
RATHER THAN SIMPLE "ON/OFF" STATES. EXAMPLES OF ANALOG INPUTS FROM SENSORS INCLUDE TEMPERATURE, PRESSURE, HUMIDITY, AND CHEMICAL CONCENTRATION.
DI (DIGITAL INPUT): A SIGNAL INPUT TO THE BUILDING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WHICH HAS A BINARY (1 OR 0) VALUE. DIGITAL INPUTS PROVIDE DATA ABOUT THE STATUS
OF A SPACE OR EQUIPMENT. EXAMPLES OF DIGITAL INPUTS INCLUDE MOTOR STATUS ("ON/OFF"), VALVE POSITION ("OPEN/CLOSED"), OCCUPANCY
("OCCUPIED/UNOCCUPIED"), OR LIMIT ALARMS SUCH AS HIGH VOLTAGE OR LOW FUEL.
AO (ANALOG OUTPUT):A SIGNAL OUTPUT FROM THE BUILDING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WHICH HAS A VARIABLE RANGE OF VALUES. ANALOG OUTPUTS PROVIDE
PROPORTIONAL CONTROL COMMANDS TO EQUIPMENT. EXAMPLES OF ANALOG OUTPUTS INCLUDE SET POINT ADJUSTMENT AND MOTOR SPEED.
DO (DIGITAL OUTPUT): A SIGNAL OUTPUT FROM THE BUILDING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WHICH HAS A BINARY (1 OR 0) VALUE. THESE OUTPUTS CONTROL
EQUIPMENT WHICH OPERATES IN TWO MAIN STATES (SUCH AS "ON" AND "OFF"). EXAMPLES OF THESE OUTPUTS INCLUDE MOTOR START/STOP AND DAMPER OR
VALVE POSITION CONTROL ("OPEN/CLOSE").
LOW LIMIT:USER DEFINED MINIMUM VALUE BEFORE ALARMING.
HIGH LIMIT:USER DEFINED MAXIMUM .
HARDWARE
FAIL ON (OPEN):CONTROLLED DEVICE REVERTS TO THE OPEN POSITION OR THE ENGAGED STATE WHEN POWER OR CONTROL SIGNAL IS LOST.
FAIL OFF (CLOSED): CONTROLLED DEVICE REVERTS TO THE CLOSED POSITION OR THE DISENGAGED STATE WHEN POWER OR CONTROL SIGNAL IS LOST.
LAST COMMANDED STATE:CONTROLLED DEVICE REMAINS IN THE SAME POSITION OR STATE, WHEN POWER OR CONTROL SIGNAL IS LOST.
FAIL MODE
NETWORK POINT:POINT IS EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE BMS. IT IS COMMUNICATED TO THE BMS THROUGH A COMMUNICATION
GATEWAY FROM ANOTHER INTELLIGENT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT OR PROVIDED BY A COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL (I.E. BACNET, LONWORKS, OR MODBUS).
CALCULATED POINT:A POINT NOT CONNECTED DIRECTLY TO THE BMS, BUT ITS VALUE IS CALCULATED BY THE DDC USING INPUT DATA. DEFINED IN
POINT SCHEDULE WHEN SPECIAL CALCULATED VALUES ARE REQUIRED BY SYSTEM DESIGN.

SEQUENCE OF OPERATION
GENERAL
THE EXISITNG PACKAGE ROOFTOP UNITS CONSIST OF DX COOLING COIL, MODULATING NATURAL GAS HEATING COIL, DRY BULB ECONOMIZER, 100% MODULATING 
POWERED EXHAUST FAN, TRANE TRACE CONTROLS, 30% FILTERS, CO2 SENSORS FOR OUTSIDE AIR CONTROL, DISCONNECT SWITCH AND CONVENIENCE OUTLET. THE 
EXISTING PACKAGE ROOFTOP UNITS (RTUS) ARE BEING CONVERTED FROM CONSTANT VOLUME OPERATION TO VARIABLE AIR VOLUME OPERATION BY REPLACING THE 
SUPPLY FAN MOTOR. ALL POINTS INDICATED ARE NEW CONTROL POINTS AND EXISITNG CONTROLS TO REMAIN UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED. 
THE UNITS SHALL BE STARTED AUTOMATICALLY THROUGH THE BMS. THE H-O-A SWITCH SHALL BE KEPT IN THE "AUTO" POSITION. "HAND" AND "OFF" POSITIONS SHALL BE 
USED ONLY FOR MAINTENANCE. THE BMS SHALL START AND STOP THE RTUS FOR OCCUPIED AND UNOCCUPIED HOURS BASED ON AN ADJUSTABLE TIME SCHEDULE. 
DURING THE OCCUPIED HOURS, THE RTUS RUNS CONTINUOUSLY. DURING THE UNOCCUPIED HOURS, THE RTUS SHALL BE STARTED AND STOPPED TO MAINTAIN A NIGHT 
SETBACK TEMPERATURE OF 60°F (ADJUSTABLE) MINIMUM AND 85°F (ADJUSTABLE) MAXIMUM.
DISCHARGE TEMPERATURE CONTROL
THE EXISTING UNIT CONTROLS SHALL START AND STOP THE EVAPORATOR FAN, NATURAL GAS HEATING COIL, POWER EXHAUST FAN, CONDENSING FAN AND 
COMPRESSORS TO CONTROL THE LEAVING AIR TEMPERATURE OF 55°F.  THE UNIT CONTROLS SHALL RESET THE SUPPLY AIR TEMPERATURE UP OR DOWN WHILE 
MAINTAINING THE ROOM REQUIRING THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF COOLING. THE SUPPLY AIR TEMPERATURE SHALL BE RESET UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 65°F (ADJ). UPON A 
RISE IN RETURN HUMIDITY ABOVE 60% (ADJUSTABLE), THE UNIT CONTROLS SHALL MODULATE TO MEET A DISCHARGE AIR TEMPERATURE OF 55°F (ADJUSTABLE) AND 
MODULATE VAV TERMINAL UNIT HEATING HOT WATER VALVES TO MEET SPACE TEMPERATURE OF 75°F (ADJUSTABLE).
SUPPLY FAN CONTROL
THE SUPPLY FAN SHALL BE OPERATED TO MAINTAIN STATIC PRESSURE IN THE SUPPLY AIR DUCT AT THE SUPPLY AIR STATIC PRESSURE SET-POINT, WHICH SHALL INITIALLY 
BE SET AT 1.25" WG (ADJUSTABLE). THE STATIC PRESSURE SENSORS ARE LOCATED 2/3 DOWN THE SUPPLY DUCTWORK FROM THE SUPPLY FAN. AS THE STATIC PRESSURE 
FALLS BELOW SET-POINT AT THE STATIC PRESSURE SENSORS, THE SPEED OF THE SUPPLY FAN SHALL BE INCREASED. AS THE STATIC PRESSURE RISES ABOVE SET-POINT 
AT THE STATIC PRESSURE SENSORS, THE SPEED OF THE SUPPLY FAN SHALL BE DECREASED. 
A STATIC PRESSURE RESET SEQUENCE SHALL BE INCORPORATED TO REDUCE FAN ENERGY. THE STATIC PRESSURE END OF LINE SET-POINT SHALL BE RESET TO 
MAINTAIN THE MINIMUM STATIC PRESSURE REQUIRED TO SATISFY THE CRITICAL ZONE AIRFLOW (WORST CASE OR BOX WITH THE FURTHEST OPEN DAMPER). THE MINIMUM 
STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT SHALL BE INITIALLY SET TO 0.75" WG (ADJUSTABLE).  THE MAXIMUM STATIC PRESSURE SETPOINT SHALL BE DETERMINED BY THE TEST AND 
BALANCE CONTRACTOR. THE BMS SHALL CONTINUOUSLY POLL EACH INDIVIDUAL BOX TO DETERMINE WHICH BOX HAS THE FURTHEST OPEN DAMPER. THE SUPPLY AIR 
SHALL RESET ITS STATIC PRESSURE SET-POINT DOWNWARD UNTIL ANY ONE BOX IS 90% OPEN. WHEN ANY BOX REACHES 95% OR MORE OPEN, RESET THE SUPPLY AIR 
STATIC PRESSURE SET-POINT UPWARDS.
ECONOMIZER AND POWERED EXHAUST FAN CONTROL
THE EXISTING UNIT CONTROLS SHALL BE MAINTAINED TO OPERATE THE AIRSIDE ECONOMZIER AND POWERED EXHAUST FAN.  POWERED EXHAUST FAN SHALL ALSO 
OPERATE TO MAINTAIN BUILDING PRESSURE. 
DEMAND CONTROL VENTILATION
THE EXISITNG UNIT CONTROLS SHALL BE MODIFIED TO MODULATE THE OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER OPEN TO MINIMUM POSITION UPON UNIT STARTUP.  THE BMS CONTINUALLY 
MONITORS THE ASSOCIATED CO2 SENSORS. MODULATE THE OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER TO MAINTAIN CO2 LEVELS OF 500 PPM (ADJUSTABLE) GREATER THAN OUTSIDE AIR.  
UPON THE SPACE MAINTAINING CO2 LEVELS FOR 15 MINUTES (ADJUSTABLE), MODULATE THE OUTSIDE AIR DAMPER CLOSED TO MAINTAIN A CO2 LEVEL OF 500 PPM 
GREATER THAN OUTSIDE AIR.  
SAFETIES AND ALARMS
THE SUPPLY FANS AND RETURN FANS SHALL BE INTERLOCKED WITH THE FIRE ALARM SYSTEM THROUGH A CONTROL MODULE (CM). THE CONTROL MODULE SHALL BE 
HARD-WIRED INTERLOCKED TO CONTROL THE FANS IN THE "HAND" AND "AUTO" OPERATING MODES. THE DUCT SMOKE DETECTORS LOCATED IN THE SUPPLY AND RETURN 
AIR WILL BE MONITORED BY THE FIRE ALARM SYSTEM. WHEN PRODUCTS OF COMBUSTION ARE SENSED BY ONE OF THE SUPPLY OR RETURN AIR DUCT SMOKE 
DETECTORS, THE CONTROL MODULE SHALL STOP THE FANS.
WHEN THE HIGH LIMIT PRESSURE SWITCH TRIPS, THE SUPPLY FAN SHALL BE STOPPED AND AN ALARM SHALL BE GENERATED AT THE BMS. THE HIGH PRESSURE SWITCH 
SHALL BE SET TO TRIP AT 2.5" WG (ADJUSTABLE) AND HARDWIRED TO THE VFD. ONCE TRIPPED, THE SWITCH MUST BE MANUALLY RESET. 
WHEN THE PRESSURE EXCEEDS AN ADJUSTABLE LIMIT, AN ALARM SIGNAL WILL BE GENERATED AT THE BMS. UNIT'S CONTROLLER SHALL MONITOR THE STATUS OF THE 
FAN. IF THE STATUS INDICATED DOES NOT MATCH THE COMMANDED OUTPUT, AN ALARM SHALL BE GENERATED AT THE BMS. 
THE BMS SHALL MONITOR THE VENTILATION FLOW RATE AND CO2 LEVELS AND GENERATE AN ALARM IF EITHER VARIES BE 10% OR MORE FROM SETPOINTS.
UPON POWER FAILURE, RESTART UNIT AT LAST OPERATING CONDITION.
