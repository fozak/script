When the VM executes a compiledtrace, it cannot guarantee that the same path will be followedor that the same types will occur in subsequent loop iterations.Alt textAdded testHence, recording and compiling a tracespeculatesthat the path andtyping will be exactly as they were during recording for subsequentiterations of the loop.Every compiled trace contains all theguards(checks) requiredto validate the speculation. If one of the guards fails (if controlÔ¨Çow is different, or a value of a different type is generated), thetrace exits. If an exit becomes hot, the VM can record abranchtracestarting at the exit to cover the new path. In this way, the VMrecords atrace treecovering all the hot paths through the loop.Nested loops can be difÔ¨Åcult to optimize for tracing VMs. Ina na¬®ƒ±ve implementation, inner loops would become hot Ô¨Årst, andthe VM would start tracing there. When the inner loop exits, theVM would detect that a different branch was taken. The VM wouldtry to record a branch trace, and Ô¨Ånd that the trace reaches not theinner loop header, but the outer loop header. At this point, the VMcould continue tracing until it reaches the inner loop header again,thus tracing the outer loop inside a trace tree for the inner loop.But this requires tracing a copy of the outer loop for every side exitand type combination in the inner loop. In essence, this is a formof unintended tail duplication, which can easily overÔ¨Çow the codecache. Alternatively, the VM could simply stop tracing, and give upon ever tracing outer loops.We solve the nested loop problem by recordingnested tracetrees. Our system traces the inner loop exactly as the na¬®ƒ±ve version.The system stops extending the inner tree when it reaches an outerloop, but then it starts a new trace at the outer loop header. Whenthe outer loop reaches the inner loop header, the system tries to callthe trace tree for the inner loop. If the call succeeds, the VM recordsthe call to the inner tree as part of the outer trace and Ô¨Ånishesthe outer trace as normal. In this way, our system can trace anynumber of loops nested to any depth without causing excessive tailduplication.These techniques allow a VM to dynamically translate a pro-gram to nested, type-specialized trace trees. Because traces cancross function call boundaries, our techniques also achieve the ef-fects of inlining. Because traces have no internal control-Ô¨Çow joins,they can be optimized in linear time by a simple compiler (10).Thus, our tracing VM efÔ¨Åciently performs the same kind of op-timizations that would require interprocedural analysis in a staticoptimization setting. This makes tracing an attractive and effectivetool to type specialize even complex function call-rich code.We implemented these techniques for an existing JavaScript in-terpreter, SpiderMonkey. We call the resulting tracing VMTrace-Monkey. TraceMonkey supports all the JavaScript features of Spi-derMonkey, with a 2x-20x speedup for traceable programs.This paper makes the following contributions:‚Ä¢We explain an algorithm for dynamically forming trace trees tocover a program, representing nested loops as nested trace trees.‚Ä¢We explain how to speculatively generate efÔ¨Åcient type-specializedcode for traces from dynamic language programs.‚Ä¢We validate our tracing techniques in an implementation basedon the SpiderMonkey JavaScript interpreter, achieving 2x-20xspeedups on many programs.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 3 isa general overview of trace tree based compilation we use to cap-ture and compile frequently executed code regions. In Section 4we describe our approach of covering nested loops using a num-ber of individual trace trees. In Section 5 we describe our trace-compilation based speculative type specialization approach we useto generate efÔ¨Åcient machine code from recorded bytecode traces.Our implementation of a dynamic type-specializing compiler forJavaScript is described in Section 6. Related work is discussed inSection 8. In Section 7 we evaluate our dynamic compiler based on1 for (var i = 2; i < 100; ++i) {2if (!primes[i])3continue;4for (var k = i + i; i < 100; k += i)5primes[k] = false;6 }Figure 1.

The paper ends with conclusions inSection 9 and an outlook on future work is presented in Section 10.2.Overview: Example Tracing RunThis section provides an overview of our system by describinghow TraceMonkey executes an example program. The exampleprogram, shown in Figure 1, computes the Ô¨Årst 100 prime numberswith nested loops. The narrative should be read along with Figure 2,which describes the activities TraceMonkey performs and when ittransitions between the loops.TraceMonkey always begins executing a program in the byte-code interpreter. Every loop back edge is a potential trace point.When the interpreter crosses a loop edge, TraceMonkey invokesthetrace monitor, which may decide to record or execute a nativetrace. At the start of execution, there are no compiled traces yet, sothe trace monitor counts the number of times each loop back edge isexecuted until a loop becomeshot, currently after 2 crossings. Notethat the way our loops are compiled, the loop edge is crossed beforeentering the loop, so the second crossing occurs immediately afterthe Ô¨Årst iteration.Here is the sequence of events broken down by outer loopiteration:v0 := ld state[748]// load primes from the trace activation recordst sp[0], v0// store primes to interpreter stackv1 := ld state[764]// load k from the trace activation recordv2 := i2f(v1)// convert k from int to doublest sp[8], v1// store k to interpreter stackst sp[16], 0// store false to interpreter stackv3 := ld v0[4]// load class word for primesv4 := and v3, -4// mask out object class tag for primesv5 := eq v4, Array// test whether primes is an arrayxf v5// side exit if v5 is falsev6 := js_Array_set(v0, v2, false)// call function to set array elementv7 := eq v6, 0// test return value from callxt v7// side exit if js_Array_set returns false.Figure 3. LIR snippet for sample program.This is the LIR recorded for line 5 of the sample program in Figure 1. The LIR encodesthe semantics in SSA form using temporary variables. The LIR also encodes all the stores that the interpreter would do to its data stack.Sometimes these stores can be optimized away as the stack locations are live only on exits to the interpreter. Finally, the LIR records guardsand side exits to verify the assumptions made in this recording: thatprimesis an array and that the call to set its element succeeds.mov edx, ebx(748)// load primes from the trace activation recordmov edi(0), edx// (*) store primes to interpreter stackmov esi, ebx(764)// load k from the trace activation recordmov edi(8), esi// (*) store k to interpreter stackmov edi(16), 0// (*) store false to interpreter stackmov eax, edx(4)// (*) load object class word for primesand eax, -4// (*) mask out object class tag for primescmp eax, Array// (*) test whether primes is an arrayjne side_exit_1// (*) side exit if primes is not an arraysub esp, 8// bump stack for call alignment conventionpush false// push last argument for callpush esi// push first argument for callcall js_Array_set// call function to set array elementadd esp, 8// clean up extra stack spacemov ecx, ebx// (*) created by register allocatortest eax, eax// (*) test return value of js_Array_setje side_exit_2// (*) side exit if call failed...side_exit_1:mov ecx, ebp(-4)// restore ecxmov esp, ebp// restore espjmp epilog// jump to ret statementFigure 4. x86 snippet for sample program.This is the x86 code compiled from the LIR snippet in Figure 3. Most LIR instructions compileto a single x86 instruction. Instructions marked with(*)would be omitted by an idealized compiler that knew that none of the side exitswould ever be taken. The 17 instructions generated by the compiler compare favorably with the 100+ instructions that the interpreter wouldexecute for the same code snippet, including 4 indirect jumps.i=2.This is the Ô¨Årst iteration of the outer loop. The loop onlines 4-5 becomes hot on its second iteration, so TraceMonkey en-ters recording mode on line 4. In recording mode, TraceMonkeyrecords the code along the trace in a low-level compiler intermedi-ate representation we callLIR. The LIR trace encodes all the oper-ations performed and the types of all operands. The LIR trace alsoencodesguards, which are checks that verify that the control Ô¨Çowand types are identical to those observed during trace recording.Thus, on later executions, if and only if all guards are passed, thetrace has the required program semantics.TraceMonkey stops recording when execution returns to theloop header or exits the loop. In this case, execution returns to theloop header on line 4.After recording is Ô¨Ånished, TraceMonkey compiles the trace tonative code using the recorded type information for optimization.The result is a native code fragment that can be entered if theinterpreter PC and the types of values match those observed whentrace recording was started. The Ô¨Årst trace in our example,T45,covers lines 4 and 5. This trace can be entered if the PC is at line 4,iandkare integers, andprimesis an object. After compilingT45,TraceMonkey returns to the interpreter and loops back to line 1.i=3.Now the loop header at line 1 has become hot, so Trace-Monkey starts recording. When recording reaches line 4, Trace-Monkey observes that it has reached an inner loop header that al-ready has a compiled trace, so TraceMonkey attempts to nest theinner loop inside the current trace. The Ô¨Årst step is to call the innertrace as a subroutine. This executes the loop on line 4 to completionand then returns to the recorder. TraceMonkey veriÔ¨Åes that the callwas successful and then records the call to the inner trace as part ofthe current trace. Recording continues until execution reaches line1, and at which point TraceMonkey Ô¨Ånishes and compiles a tracefor the outer loop,T16.</div>\n",

In this domain, in order to provide a Ô¨Çuid userexperience and enable a new generation of applications, virtual ma-chines must provide a low startup time and high performance.Compilers for statically typed languages rely on type informa-tion to generate efÔ¨Åcient machine code. In a dynamically typed pro-gramming language such as JavaScript, the types of expressionsmay vary at runtime. This means that the compiler can no longereasily transform operations into machine instructions that operateon one speciÔ¨Åc type. Without exact type information, the compilermust emit slower generalized machine code that can deal with allpotential type combinations. While compile-time static type infer-ence might be able to gather type information to generate opti-mized machine code, traditional static analysis is very expensiveand hence not well suited for the highly interactive environment ofa web browser.We present a trace-based compilation technique for dynamiclanguages that reconciles speed of compilation with excellent per-formance of the generated machine code. Our system uses a mixed-mode execution approach: the system starts running JavaScript in afast-starting bytecode interpreter. As the program runs, the systemidentiÔ¨Åeshot(frequently executed) bytecode sequences, recordsthem, and compiles them to fast native code. We call such a se-quence of instructions atrace.Unlike method-based dynamic compilers, our dynamic com-piler operates at the granularity of individual loops. This designchoice is based on the expectation that programs spend most oftheir time in hot loops. Even in dynamically typed languages, weexpect hot loops to be mostlytype-stable, meaning that the types ofvalues are invariant. (12) For example, we would expect loop coun-ters that start as integers to remain integers for all iterations. Whenboth of these expectations hold, a trace-based compiler can coverthe program execution with a small number of type-specialized, ef-Ô¨Åciently compiled traces.Each compiled trace covers one path through the program withone mapping of values to types. When the VM executes a compiledtrace, it cannot guarantee that the same path will be followedor that the same types will occur in subsequent loop iterations.Alt textAdded testHence, recording and compiling a tracespeculatesthat the path andtyping will be exactly as they were during recording for subsequentiterations of the loop.Every compiled trace contains all theguards(checks) requiredto validate the speculation. If one of the guards fails (if controlÔ¨Çow is different, or a value of a different type is generated), thetrace exits. If an exit becomes hot, the VM can record abranchtracestarting at the exit to cover the new path. In this way, the VMrecords atrace treecovering all the hot paths through the loop.Nested loops can be difÔ¨Åcult to optimize for tracing VMs. Ina na¬®ƒ±ve implementation, inner loops would become hot Ô¨Årst, andthe VM would start tracing there. When the inner loop exits, theVM would detect that a different branch was taken. The VM wouldtry to record a branch trace, and Ô¨Ånd that the trace reaches not theinner loop header, but the outer loop header. At this point, the VMcould continue tracing until it reaches the inner loop header again,thus tracing the outer loop inside a trace tree for the inner loop.But this requires tracing a copy of the outer loop for every side exitand type combination in the inner loop. In essence, this is a formof unintended tail duplication, which can easily overÔ¨Çow the codecache. Alternatively, the VM could simply stop tracing, and give upon ever tracing outer loops.We solve the nested loop problem by recordingnested tracetrees. Our system traces the inner loop exactly as the na¬®ƒ±ve version.The system stops extending the inner tree when it reaches an outerloop, but then it starts a new trace at the outer loop header. Whenthe outer loop reaches the inner loop header, the system tries to callthe trace tree for the inner loop. If the call succeeds, the VM recordsthe call to the inner tree as part of the outer trace and Ô¨Ånishesthe outer trace as normal. In this way, our system can trace anynumber of loops nested to any depth without causing excessive tailduplication.These techniques allow a VM to dynamically translate a pro-gram to nested, type-specialized trace trees. Because traces cancross function call boundaries, our techniques also achieve the ef-fects of inlining. Because traces have no internal control-Ô¨Çow joins,they can be optimized in linear time by a simple compiler (10).Thus, our tracing VM efÔ¨Åciently performs the same kind of op-timizations that would require interprocedural analysis in a staticoptimization setting. This makes tracing an attractive and effectivetool to type specialize even complex function call-rich code.We implemented these techniques for an existing JavaScript in-terpreter, SpiderMonkey. We call the resulting tracing VMTrace-Monkey. TraceMonkey supports all the JavaScript features of Spi-derMonkey, with a 2x-20x speedup for traceable programs.This paper makes the following contributions:‚Ä¢We explain an algorithm for dynamically forming trace trees tocover a program, representing nested loops as nested trace trees.‚Ä¢We explain how to speculatively generate efÔ¨Åcient type-specializedcode for traces from dynamic language programs.‚Ä¢We validate our tracing techniques in an implementation basedon the SpiderMonkey JavaScript interpreter, achieving 2x-20xspeedups on many programs.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

The exampleprogram, shown in Figure 1, computes the Ô¨Årst 100 prime numberswith nested loops. The narrative should be read along with Figure 2,which describes the activities TraceMonkey performs and when ittransitions between the loops.TraceMonkey always begins executing a program in the byte-code interpreter. Every loop back edge is a potential trace point.When the interpreter crosses a loop edge, TraceMonkey invokesthetrace monitor, which may decide to record or execute a nativetrace. At the start of execution, there are no compiled traces yet, sothe trace monitor counts the number of times each loop back edge isexecuted until a loop becomeshot, currently after 2 crossings. Notethat the way our loops are compiled, the loop edge is crossed beforeentering the loop, so the second crossing occurs immediately afterthe Ô¨Årst iteration.Here is the sequence of events broken down by outer loopiteration:v0 := ld state[748]// load primes from the trace activation recordst sp[0], v0// store primes to interpreter stackv1 := ld state[764]// load k from the trace activation recordv2 := i2f(v1)// convert k from int to doublest sp[8], v1// store k to interpreter stackst sp[16], 0// store false to interpreter stackv3 := ld v0[4]// load class word for primesv4 := and v3, -4// mask out object class tag for primesv5 := eq v4, Array// test whether primes is an arrayxf v5// side exit if v5 is falsev6 := js_Array_set(v0, v2, false)// call function to set array elementv7 := eq v6, 0// test return value from callxt v7// side exit if js_Array_set returns false.Figure 3.

The LIR also encodes all the stores that the interpreter would do to its data stack.Sometimes these stores can be optimized away as the stack locations are live only on exits to the interpreter. Finally, the LIR records guardsand side exits to verify the assumptions made in this recording: thatprimesis an array and that the call to set its element succeeds.mov edx, ebx(748)// load primes from the trace activation recordmov edi(0), edx// (*) store primes to interpreter stackmov esi, ebx(764)// load k from the trace activation recordmov edi(8), esi// (*) store k to interpreter stackmov edi(16), 0// (*) store false to interpreter stackmov eax, edx(4)// (*) load object class word for primesand eax, -4// (*) mask out object class tag for primescmp eax, Array// (*) test whether primes is an arrayjne side_exit_1// (*) side exit if primes is not an arraysub esp, 8// bump stack for call alignment conventionpush false// push last argument for callpush esi// push first argument for callcall js_Array_set// call function to set array elementadd esp, 8// clean up extra stack spacemov ecx, ebx// (*) created by register allocatortest eax, eax// (*) test return value of js_Array_setje side_exit_2// (*) side exit if call failed...side_exit_1:mov ecx, ebp(-4)// restore ecxmov esp, ebp// restore espjmp epilog// jump to ret statementFigure 4. x86 snippet for sample program.This is the x86 code compiled from the LIR snippet in Figure 3. Most LIR instructions compileto a single x86 instruction. Instructions marked with(*)would be omitted by an idealized compiler that knew that none of the side exitswould ever be taken. The 17 instructions generated by the compiler compare favorably with the 100+ instructions that the interpreter wouldexecute for the same code snippet, including 4 indirect jumps.i=2.This is the Ô¨Årst iteration of the outer loop. The loop onlines 4-5 becomes hot on its second iteration, so TraceMonkey en-ters recording mode on line 4.

The LIR trace encodes all the oper-ations performed and the types of all operands. The LIR trace alsoencodesguards, which are checks that verify that the control Ô¨Çowand types are identical to those observed during trace recording.Thus, on later executions, if and only if all guards are passed, thetrace has the required program semantics.TraceMonkey stops recording when execution returns to theloop header or exits the loop. In this case, execution returns to theloop header on line 4.After recording is Ô¨Ånished, TraceMonkey compiles the trace tonative code using the recorded type information for optimization.The result is a native code fragment that can be entered if theinterpreter PC and the types of values match those observed whentrace recording was started. The Ô¨Årst trace in our example,T45,covers lines 4 and 5. This trace can be entered if the PC is at line 4,iandkare integers, andprimesis an object. After compilingT45,TraceMonkey returns to the interpreter and loops back to line 1.i=3.Now the loop header at line 1 has become hot, so Trace-Monkey starts recording. When recording reaches line 4, Trace-Monkey observes that it has reached an inner loop header that al-ready has a compiled trace, so TraceMonkey attempts to nest theinner loop inside the current trace. The Ô¨Årst step is to call the innertrace as a subroutine. This executes the loop on line 4 to completionand then returns to the recorder. TraceMonkey veriÔ¨Åes that the callwas successful and then records the call to the inner trace as part ofthe current trace. Recording continues until execution reaches line1, and at which point TraceMonkey Ô¨Ånishes and compiles a tracefor the outer loop,T16.Enter the password to open this PDF file.CancelOKFile name:-File size:-Title:-Author:-Subject:-Keywords:-Creation Date:-Modification Date:-Creator:-PDF Producer:-PDF Version:-Page Count:-Page Size:-Fast Web View:-CloseChoose an optionAlt text (alternative text) helps when people can‚Äôt see the image or when it doesn‚Äôt load.Add a descriptionAim for 1-2 sentences that describe the subject, setting, or actions.Mark as decorativeThis is used for ornamental images, like borders or watermarks.CancelSaveEdit alt text (image description)Short description for people who can‚Äôt see the image or when the image doesn‚Äôt load.This alt text was created automatically and may be inaccurate.Learn moreCreate alt text automaticallyDownloading alt text AI model (‚Å®0‚Å© of ‚Å®0‚Å© MB)Couldn‚Äôt create alt text automaticallyPlease write your own alt text or try again later.CloseCancelNot nowSaveImage alt text settingsAutomatic alt textCreate alt text automaticallySuggests descriptions to help people who can‚Äôt see the image or when the image doesn‚Äôt load.Learn moreAlt text AI model (‚Å®180‚Å© MB)Runs locally on your device so your data stays private.

In this domain, in order to provide a Ô¨Çuid userexperience and enable a new generation of applications, virtual ma-chines must provide a low startup time and high performance.Compilers for statically typed languages rely on type informa-tion to generate efÔ¨Åcient machine code. In a dynamically typed pro-gramming language such as JavaScript, the types of expressionsmay vary at runtime. This means that the compiler can no longereasily transform operations into machine instructions that operateon one speciÔ¨Åc type. Without exact type information, the compilermust emit slower generalized machine code that can deal with allpotential type combinations. While compile-time static type infer-ence might be able to gather type information to generate opti-mized machine code, traditional static analysis is very expensiveand hence not well suited for the highly interactive environment ofa web browser.We present a trace-based compilation technique for dynamiclanguages that reconciles speed of compilation with excellent per-formance of the generated machine code. Our system uses a mixed-mode execution approach: the system starts running JavaScript in afast-starting bytecode interpreter. As the program runs, the systemidentiÔ¨Åeshot(frequently executed) bytecode sequences, recordsthem, and compiles them to fast native code. We call such a se-quence of instructions atrace.Unlike method-based dynamic compilers, our dynamic com-piler operates at the granularity of individual loops. This designchoice is based on the expectation that programs spend most oftheir time in hot loops. Even in dynamically typed languages, weexpect hot loops to be mostlytype-stable, meaning that the types ofvalues are invariant. (12) For example, we would expect loop coun-ters that start as integers to remain integers for all iterations. Whenboth of these expectations hold, a trace-based compiler can coverthe program execution with a small number of type-specialized, ef-Ô¨Åciently compiled traces.Each compiled trace covers one path through the program withone mapping of values to types. When the VM executes a compiledtrace, it cannot guarantee that the same path will be followedor that the same types will occur in subsequent loop iterations.Alt textAdded testHence, recording and compiling a tracespeculatesthat the path andtyping will be exactly as they were during recording for subsequentiterations of the loop.Every compiled trace contains all theguards(checks) requiredto validate the speculation. If one of the guards fails (if controlÔ¨Çow is different, or a value of a different type is generated), thetrace exits. If an exit becomes hot, the VM can record abranchtracestarting at the exit to cover the new path. In this way, the VMrecords atrace treecovering all the hot paths through the loop.Nested loops can be difÔ¨Åcult to optimize for tracing VMs. Ina na¬®ƒ±ve implementation, inner loops would become hot Ô¨Årst, andthe VM would start tracing there. When the inner loop exits, theVM would detect that a different branch was taken. The VM wouldtry to record a branch trace, and Ô¨Ånd that the trace reaches not theinner loop header, but the outer loop header. At this point, the VMcould continue tracing until it reaches the inner loop header again,thus tracing the outer loop inside a trace tree for the inner loop.But this requires tracing a copy of the outer loop for every side exitand type combination in the inner loop. In essence, this is a formof unintended tail duplication, which can easily overÔ¨Çow the codecache. Alternatively, the VM could simply stop tracing, and give upon ever tracing outer loops.We solve the nested loop problem by recordingnested tracetrees. Our system traces the inner loop exactly as the na¬®ƒ±ve version.The system stops extending the inner tree when it reaches an outerloop, but then it starts a new trace at the outer loop header. Whenthe outer loop reaches the inner loop header, the system tries to callthe trace tree for the inner loop. If the call succeeds, the VM recordsthe call to the inner tree as part of the outer trace and Ô¨Ånishesthe outer trace as normal. In this way, our system can trace anynumber of loops nested to any depth without causing excessive tailduplication.These techniques allow a VM to dynamically translate a pro-gram to nested, type-specialized trace trees. Because traces cancross function call boundaries, our techniques also achieve the ef-fects of inlining. Because traces have no internal control-Ô¨Çow joins,they can be optimized in linear time by a simple compiler (10).Thus, our tracing VM efÔ¨Åciently performs the same kind of op-timizations that would require interprocedural analysis in a staticoptimization setting. This makes tracing an attractive and effectivetool to type specialize even complex function call-rich code.We implemented these techniques for an existing JavaScript in-terpreter, SpiderMonkey. We call the resulting tracing VMTrace-Monkey. TraceMonkey supports all the JavaScript features of Spi-derMonkey, with a 2x-20x speedup for traceable programs.This paper makes the following contributions:‚Ä¢We explain an algorithm for dynamically forming trace trees tocover a program, representing nested loops as nested trace trees.‚Ä¢We explain how to speculatively generate efÔ¨Åcient type-specializedcode for traces from dynamic language programs.‚Ä¢We validate our tracing techniques in an implementation basedon the SpiderMonkey JavaScript interpreter, achieving 2x-20xspeedups on many programs.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

The paper ends with conclusions inSection 9 and an outlook on future work is presented in Section 10.2.Overview: Example Tracing RunThis section provides an overview of our system by describinghow TraceMonkey executes an example program. The exampleprogram, shown in Figure 1, computes the Ô¨Årst 100 prime numberswith nested loops. The narrative should be read along with Figure 2,which describes the activities TraceMonkey performs and when ittransitions between the loops.TraceMonkey always begins executing a program in the byte-code interpreter. Every loop back edge is a potential trace point.When the interpreter crosses a loop edge, TraceMonkey invokesthetrace monitor, which may decide to record or execute a nativetrace. At the start of execution, there are no compiled traces yet, sothe trace monitor counts the number of times each loop back edge isexecuted until a loop becomeshot, currently after 2 crossings. Notethat the way our loops are compiled, the loop edge is crossed beforeentering the loop, so the second crossing occurs immediately afterthe Ô¨Årst iteration.Here is the sequence of events broken down by outer loopiteration:v0 := ld state[748]// load primes from the trace activation recordst sp[0], v0// store primes to interpreter stackv1 := ld state[764]// load k from the trace activation recordv2 := i2f(v1)// convert k from int to doublest sp[8], v1// store k to interpreter stackst sp[16], 0// store false to interpreter stackv3 := ld v0[4]// load class word for primesv4 := and v3, -4// mask out object class tag for primesv5 := eq v4, Array// test whether primes is an arrayxf v5// side exit if v5 is falsev6 := js_Array_set(v0, v2, false)// call function to set array elementv7 := eq v6, 0// test return value from callxt v7// side exit if js_Array_set returns false.Figure 3. LIR snippet for sample program.This is the LIR recorded for line 5 of the sample program in Figure 1. The LIR encodesthe semantics in SSA form using temporary variables. The LIR also encodes all the stores that the interpreter would do to its data stack.Sometimes these stores can be optimized away as the stack locations are live only on exits to the interpreter. Finally, the LIR records guardsand side exits to verify the assumptions made in this recording: thatprimesis an array and that the call to set its element succeeds.mov edx, ebx(748)// load primes from the trace activation recordmov edi(0), edx// (*) store primes to interpreter stackmov esi, ebx(764)// load k from the trace activation recordmov edi(8), esi// (*) store k to interpreter stackmov edi(16), 0// (*) store false to interpreter stackmov eax, edx(4)// (*) load object class word for primesand eax, -4// (*) mask out object class tag for primescmp eax, Array// (*) test whether primes is an arrayjne side_exit_1// (*) side exit if primes is not an arraysub esp, 8// bump stack for call alignment conventionpush false// push last argument for callpush esi// push first argument for callcall js_Array_set// call function to set array elementadd esp, 8// clean up extra stack spacemov ecx, ebx// (*) created by register allocatortest eax, eax// (*) test return value of js_Array_setje side_exit_2// (*) side exit if call failed...side_exit_1:mov ecx, ebp(-4)// restore ecxmov esp, ebp// restore espjmp epilog// jump to ret statementFigure 4. x86 snippet for sample program.This is the x86 code compiled from the LIR snippet in Figure 3. Most LIR instructions compileto a single x86 instruction. Instructions marked with(*)would be omitted by an idealized compiler that knew that none of the side exitswould ever be taken. The 17 instructions generated by the compiler compare favorably with the 100+ instructions that the interpreter wouldexecute for the same code snippet, including 4 indirect jumps.i=2.This is the Ô¨Årst iteration of the outer loop. The loop onlines 4-5 becomes hot on its second iteration, so TraceMonkey en-ters recording mode on line 4. In recording mode, TraceMonkeyrecords the code along the trace in a low-level compiler intermedi-ate representation we callLIR. The LIR trace encodes all the oper-ations performed and the types of all operands. The LIR trace alsoencodesguards, which are checks that verify that the control Ô¨Çowand types are identical to those observed during trace recording.Thus, on later executions, if and only if all guards are passed, thetrace has the required program semantics.TraceMonkey stops recording when execution returns to theloop header or exits the loop. In this case, execution returns to theloop header on line 4.After recording is Ô¨Ånished, TraceMonkey compiles the trace tonative code using the recorded type information for optimization.The result is a native code fragment that can be entered if theinterpreter PC and the types of values match those observed whentrace recording was started. The Ô¨Årst trace in our example,T45,covers lines 4 and 5. This trace can be entered if the PC is at line 4,iandkare integers, andprimesis an object. After compilingT45,TraceMonkey returns to the interpreter and loops back to line 1.i=3.Now the loop header at line 1 has become hot, so Trace-Monkey starts recording. When recording reaches line 4, Trace-Monkey observes that it has reached an inner loop header that al-ready has a compiled trace, so TraceMonkey attempts to nest theinner loop inside the current trace. The Ô¨Årst step is to call the innertrace as a subroutine. This executes the loop on line 4 to completionand then returns to the recorder. TraceMonkey veriÔ¨Åes that the callwas successful and then records the call to the inner trace as part ofthe current trace. Recording continues until execution reaches line1, and at which point TraceMonkey Ô¨Ånishes and compiles a tracefor the outer loop,T16.</div>\n",

The paper ends with conclusions inSection 9 and an outlook on future work is presented in Section 10.2.Overview: Example Tracing RunThis section provides an overview of our system by describinghow TraceMonkey executes an example program. The exampleprogram, shown in Figure 1, computes the Ô¨Årst 100 prime numberswith nested loops. The narrative should be read along with Figure 2,which describes the activities TraceMonkey performs and when ittransitions between the loops.TraceMonkey always begins executing a program in the byte-code interpreter. Every loop back edge is a potential trace point.When the interpreter crosses a loop edge, TraceMonkey invokesthetrace monitor, which may decide to record or execute a nativetrace. At the start of execution, there are no compiled traces yet, sothe trace monitor counts the number of times each loop back edge isexecuted until a loop becomeshot, currently after 2 crossings. Notethat the way our loops are compiled, the loop edge is crossed beforeentering the loop, so the second crossing occurs immediately afterthe Ô¨Årst iteration.Here is the sequence of events broken down by outer loopiteration:v0 := ld state[748]// load primes from the trace activation recordst sp[0], v0// store primes to interpreter stackv1 := ld state[764]// load k from the trace activation recordv2 := i2f(v1)// convert k from int to doublest sp[8], v1// store k to interpreter stackst sp[16], 0// store false to interpreter stackv3 := ld v0[4]// load class word for primesv4 := and v3, -4// mask out object class tag for primesv5 := eq v4, Array// test whether primes is an arrayxf v5// side exit if v5 is falsev6 := js_Array_set(v0, v2, false)// call function to set array elementv7 := eq v6, 0// test return value from callxt v7// side exit if js_Array_set returns false.Figure 3. LIR snippet for sample program.This is the LIR recorded for line 5 of the sample program in Figure 1. The LIR encodesthe semantics in SSA form using temporary variables. The LIR also encodes all the stores that the interpreter would do to its data stack.Sometimes these stores can be optimized away as the stack locations are live only on exits to the interpreter. Finally, the LIR records guardsand side exits to verify the assumptions made in this recording: thatprimesis an array and that the call to set its element succeeds.mov edx, ebx(748)// load primes from the trace activation recordmov edi(0), edx// (*) store primes to interpreter stackmov esi, ebx(764)// load k from the trace activation recordmov edi(8), esi// (*) store k to interpreter stackmov edi(16), 0// (*) store false to interpreter stackmov eax, edx(4)// (*) load object class word for primesand eax, -4// (*) mask out object class tag for primescmp eax, Array// (*) test whether primes is an arrayjne side_exit_1// (*) side exit if primes is not an arraysub esp, 8// bump stack for call alignment conventionpush false// push last argument for callpush esi// push first argument for callcall js_Array_set// call function to set array elementadd esp, 8// clean up extra stack spacemov ecx, ebx// (*) created by register allocatortest eax, eax// (*) test return value of js_Array_setje side_exit_2// (*) side exit if call failed...side_exit_1:mov ecx, ebp(-4)// restore ecxmov esp, ebp// restore espjmp epilog// jump to ret statementFigure 4. x86 snippet for sample program.This is the x86 code compiled from the LIR snippet in Figure 3. Most LIR instructions compileto a single x86 instruction. Instructions marked with(*)would be omitted by an idealized compiler that knew that none of the side exitswould ever be taken. The 17 instructions generated by the compiler compare favorably with the 100+ instructions that the interpreter wouldexecute for the same code snippet, including 4 indirect jumps.i=2.This is the Ô¨Årst iteration of the outer loop. The loop onlines 4-5 becomes hot on its second iteration, so TraceMonkey en-ters recording mode on line 4. In recording mode, TraceMonkeyrecords the code along the trace in a low-level compiler intermedi-ate representation we callLIR. The LIR trace encodes all the oper-ations performed and the types of all operands. The LIR trace alsoencodesguards, which are checks that verify that the control Ô¨Çowand types are identical to those observed during trace recording.Thus, on later executions, if and only if all guards are passed, thetrace has the required program semantics.TraceMonkey stops recording when execution returns to theloop header or exits the loop. In this case, execution returns to theloop header on line 4.After recording is Ô¨Ånished, TraceMonkey compiles the trace tonative code using the recorded type information for optimization.The result is a native code fragment that can be entered if theinterpreter PC and the types of values match those observed whentrace recording was started. The Ô¨Årst trace in our example,T45,covers lines 4 and 5. This trace can be entered if the PC is at line 4,iandkare integers, andprimesis an object. After compilingT45,TraceMonkey returns to the interpreter and loops back to line 1.i=3.Now the loop header at line 1 has become hot, so Trace-Monkey starts recording. When recording reaches line 4, Trace-Monkey observes that it has reached an inner loop header that al-ready has a compiled trace, so TraceMonkey attempts to nest theinner loop inside the current trace. The Ô¨Årst step is to call the innertrace as a subroutine. This executes the loop on line 4 to completionand then returns to the recorder. TraceMonkey veriÔ¨Åes that the callwas successful and then records the call to the inner trace as part ofthe current trace. Recording continues until execution reaches line1, and at which point TraceMonkey Ô¨Ånishes and compiles a tracefor the outer loop,T16.</div>\n",

In this domain, in order to provide a Ô¨Çuid userexperience and enable a new generation of applications, virtual ma-chines must provide a low startup time and high performance.Compilers for statically typed languages rely on type informa-tion to generate efÔ¨Åcient machine code. In a dynamically typed pro-gramming language such as JavaScript, the types of expressionsmay vary at runtime. This means that the compiler can no longereasily transform operations into machine instructions that operateon one speciÔ¨Åc type. Without exact type information, the compilermust emit slower generalized machine code that can deal with allpotential type combinations. While compile-time static type infer-ence might be able to gather type information to generate opti-mized machine code, traditional static analysis is very expensiveand hence not well suited for the highly interactive environment ofa web browser.We present a trace-based compilation technique for dynamiclanguages that reconciles speed of compilation with excellent per-formance of the generated machine code. Our system uses a mixed-mode execution approach: the system starts running JavaScript in afast-starting bytecode interpreter. As the program runs, the systemidentiÔ¨Åeshot(frequently executed) bytecode sequences, recordsthem, and compiles them to fast native code. We call such a se-quence of instructions atrace.Unlike method-based dynamic compilers, our dynamic com-piler operates at the granularity of individual loops. This designchoice is based on the expectation that programs spend most oftheir time in hot loops. Even in dynamically typed languages, weexpect hot loops to be mostlytype-stable, meaning that the types ofvalues are invariant. (12) For example, we would expect loop coun-ters that start as integers to remain integers for all iterations. Whenboth of these expectations hold, a trace-based compiler can coverthe program execution with a small number of type-specialized, ef-Ô¨Åciently compiled traces.Each compiled trace covers one path through the program withone mapping of values to types. When the VM executes a compiledtrace, it cannot guarantee that the same path will be followedor that the same types will occur in subsequent loop iterations.Hence, recording and compiling a tracespeculatesthat the path andtyping will be exactly as they were during recording for subsequentiterations of the loop.Every compiled trace contains all theguards(checks) requiredto validate the speculation. If one of the guards fails (if controlÔ¨Çow is different, or a value of a different type is generated), thetrace exits. If an exit becomes hot, the VM can record abranchtracestarting at the exit to cover the new path. In this way, the VMrecords atrace treecovering all the hot paths through the loop.Nested loops can be difÔ¨Åcult to optimize for tracing VMs. Ina na¬®ƒ±ve implementation, inner loops would become hot Ô¨Årst, andthe VM would start tracing there. When the inner loop exits, theVM would detect that a different branch was taken. The VM wouldtry to record a branch trace, and Ô¨Ånd that the trace reaches not theinner loop header, but the outer loop header. At this point, the VMcould continue tracing until it reaches the inner loop header again,thus tracing the outer loop inside a trace tree for the inner loop.But this requires tracing a copy of the outer loop for every side exitand type combination in the inner loop. In essence, this is a formof unintended tail duplication, which can easily overÔ¨Çow the codecache. Alternatively, the VM could simply stop tracing, and give upon ever tracing outer loops.We solve the nested loop problem by recordingnested tracetrees. Our system traces the inner loop exactly as the na¬®ƒ±ve version.The system stops extending the inner tree when it reaches an outerloop, but then it starts a new trace at the outer loop header. Whenthe outer loop reaches the inner loop header, the system tries to callthe trace tree for the inner loop. If the call succeeds, the VM recordsthe call to the inner tree as part of the outer trace and Ô¨Ånishesthe outer trace as normal. In this way, our system can trace anynumber of loops nested to any depth without causing excessive tailduplication.These techniques allow a VM to dynamically translate a pro-gram to nested, type-specialized trace trees. Because traces cancross function call boundaries, our techniques also achieve the ef-fects of inlining. Because traces have no internal control-Ô¨Çow joins,they can be optimized in linear time by a simple compiler (10).Thus, our tracing VM efÔ¨Åciently performs the same kind of op-timizations that would require interprocedural analysis in a staticoptimization setting. This makes tracing an attractive and effectivetool to type specialize even complex function call-rich code.We implemented these techniques for an existing JavaScript in-terpreter, SpiderMonkey. We call the resulting tracing VMTrace-Monkey. TraceMonkey supports all the JavaScript features of Spi-derMonkey, with a 2x-20x speedup for traceable programs.This paper makes the following contributions:‚Ä¢We explain an algorithm for dynamically forming trace trees tocover a program, representing nested loops as nested trace trees.‚Ä¢We explain how to speculatively generate efÔ¨Åcient type-specializedcode for traces from dynamic language programs.‚Ä¢We validate our tracing techniques in an implementation basedon the SpiderMonkey JavaScript interpreter, achieving 2x-20xspeedups on many programs.The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 3 isa general overview of trace tree based compilation we use to cap-ture and compile frequently executed code regions. In Section 4we describe our approach of covering nested loops using a num-ber of individual trace trees. In Section 5 we describe our trace-compilation based speculative type specialization approach we useto generate efÔ¨Åcient machine code from recorded bytecode traces.Our implementation of a dynamic type-specializing compiler forJavaScript is described in Section 6. Related work is discussed inSection 8. In Section 7 we evaluate our dynamic compiler based on1 for (var i = 2; i < 100; ++i) {2if (!primes[i])3continue;4for (var k = i + i; i < 100; k += i)5primes[k] = false;6 }Figure 1.

The paper ends with conclusions inSection 9 and an outlook on future work is presented in Section 10.2.Overview: Example Tracing RunThis section provides an overview of our system by describinghow TraceMonkey executes an example program. The exampleprogram, shown in Figure 1, computes the Ô¨Årst 100 prime numberswith nested loops. The narrative should be read along with Figure 2,which describes the activities TraceMonkey performs and when ittransitions between the loops.TraceMonkey always begins executing a program in the byte-code interpreter. Every loop back edge is a potential trace point.When the interpreter crosses a loop edge, TraceMonkey invokesthetrace monitor, which may decide to record or execute a nativetrace. At the start of execution, there are no compiled traces yet, sothe trace monitor counts the number of times each loop back edge isexecuted until a loop becomeshot, currently after 2 crossings. Notethat the way our loops are compiled, the loop edge is crossed beforeentering the loop, so the second crossing occurs immediately afterthe Ô¨Årst iteration.Here is the sequence of events broken down by outer loopiteration:v0 := ld state[748]// load primes from the trace activation recordst sp[0], v0// store primes to interpreter stackv1 := ld state[764]// load k from the trace activation recordv2 := i2f(v1)// convert k from int to doublest sp[8], v1// store k to interpreter stackst sp[16], 0// store false to interpreter stackv3 := ld v0[4]// load class word for primesv4 := and v3, -4// mask out object class tag for primesv5 := eq v4, Array// test whether primes is an arrayxf v5// side exit if v5 is falsev6 := js_Array_set(v0, v2, false)// call function to set array elementv7 := eq v6, 0// test return value from callxt v7// side exit if js_Array_set returns false.Figure 3. LIR snippet for sample program.This is the LIR recorded for line 5 of the sample program in Figure 1. The LIR encodesthe semantics in SSA form using temporary variables. The LIR also encodes all the stores that the interpreter would do to its data stack.Sometimes these stores can be optimized away as the stack locations are live only on exits to the interpreter. Finally, the LIR records guardsand side exits to verify the assumptions made in this recording: thatprimesis an array and that the call to set its element succeeds.mov edx, ebx(748)// load primes from the trace activation recordmov edi(0), edx// (*) store primes to interpreter stackmov esi, ebx(764)// load k from the trace activation recordmov edi(8), esi// (*) store k to interpreter stackmov edi(16), 0// (*) store false to interpreter stackmov eax, edx(4)// (*) load object class word for primesand eax, -4// (*) mask out object class tag for primescmp eax, Array// (*) test whether primes is an arrayjne side_exit_1// (*) side exit if primes is not an arraysub esp, 8// bump stack for call alignment conventionpush false// push last argument for callpush esi// push first argument for callcall js_Array_set// call function to set array elementadd esp, 8// clean up extra stack spacemov ecx, ebx// (*) created by register allocatortest eax, eax// (*) test return value of js_Array_setje side_exit_2// (*) side exit if call failed...side_exit_1:mov ecx, ebp(-4)// restore ecxmov esp, ebp// restore espjmp epilog// jump to ret statementFigure 4. x86 snippet for sample program.This is the x86 code compiled from the LIR snippet in Figure 3. Most LIR instructions compileto a single x86 instruction. Instructions marked with(*)would be omitted by an idealized compiler that knew that none of the side exitswould ever be taken. The 17 instructions generated by the compiler compare favorably with the 100+ instructions that the interpreter wouldexecute for the same code snippet, including 4 indirect jumps.i=2.This is the Ô¨Årst iteration of the outer loop. The loop onlines 4-5 becomes hot on its second iteration, so TraceMonkey en-ters recording mode on line 4. In recording mode, TraceMonkeyrecords the code along the trace in a low-level compiler intermedi-ate representation we callLIR. The LIR trace encodes all the oper-ations performed and the types of all operands. The LIR trace alsoencodesguards, which are checks that verify that the control Ô¨Çowand types are identical to those observed during trace recording.Thus, on later executions, if and only if all guards are passed, thetrace has the required program semantics.TraceMonkey stops recording when execution returns to theloop header or exits the loop. In this case, execution returns to theloop header on line 4.After recording is Ô¨Ånished, TraceMonkey compiles the trace tonative code using the recorded type information for optimization.The result is a native code fragment that can be entered if theinterpreter PC and the types of values match those observed whentrace recording was started. The Ô¨Årst trace in our example,T45,covers lines 4 and 5. This trace can be entered if the PC is at line 4,iandkare integers, andprimesis an object. After compilingT45,TraceMonkey returns to the interpreter and loops back to line 1.i=3.Now the loop header at line 1 has become hot, so Trace-Monkey starts recording. When recording reaches line 4, Trace-Monkey observes that it has reached an inner loop header that al-ready has a compiled trace, so TraceMonkey attempts to nest theinner loop inside the current trace. The Ô¨Årst step is to call the innertrace as a subroutine. This executes the loop on line 4 to completionand then returns to the recorder. TraceMonkey veriÔ¨Åes that the callwas successful and then records the call to the inner trace as part ofthe current trace. Recording continues until execution reaches line1, and at which point TraceMonkey Ô¨Ånishes and compiles a tracefor the outer loop,T16.</div>\n",

In this domain, in order to provide a Ô¨Çuid userexperience and enable a new generation of applications, virtual ma-chines must provide a low startup time and high performance.Compilers for statically typed languages rely on type informa-tion to generate efÔ¨Åcient machine code. In a dynamically typed pro-gramming language such as JavaScript, the types of expressionsmay vary at runtime. This means that the compiler can no longereasily transform operations into machine instructions that operateon one speciÔ¨Åc type. Without exact type information, the compilermust emit slower generalized machine code that can deal with allpotential type combinations. While compile-time static type infer-ence might be able to gather type information to generate opti-mized machine code, traditional static analysis is very expensiveand hence not well suited for the highly interactive environment ofa web browser.We present a trace-based compilation technique for dynamiclanguages that reconciles speed of compilation with excellent per-formance of the generated machine code. Our system uses a mixed-mode execution approach: the system starts running JavaScript in afast-starting bytecode interpreter. As the program runs, the systemidentiÔ¨Åeshot(frequently executed) bytecode sequences, recordsthem, and compiles them to fast native code. We call such a se-quence of instructions atrace.Unlike method-based dynamic compilers, our dynamic com-piler operates at the granularity of individual loops. This designchoice is based on the expectation that programs spend most oftheir time in hot loops. Even in dynamically typed languages, weexpect hot loops to be mostlytype-stable, meaning that the types ofvalues are invariant. (12) For example, we would expect loop coun-ters that start as integers to remain integers for all iterations. Whenboth of these expectations hold, a trace-based compiler can coverthe program execution with a small number of type-specialized, ef-Ô¨Åciently compiled traces.Each compiled trace covers one path through the program withone mapping of values to types. When the VM executes a compiledtrace, it cannot guarantee that the same path will be followedor that the same types will occur in subsequent loop iterations.Hence, recording and compiling a tracespeculatesthat the path andtyping will be exactly as they were during recording for subsequentiterations of the loop.Every compiled trace contains all theguards(checks) requiredto validate the speculation. If one of the guards fails (if controlÔ¨Çow is different, or a value of a different type is generated), thetrace exits. If an exit becomes hot, the VM can record abranchtracestarting at the exit to cover the new path. In this way, the VMrecords atrace treecovering all the hot paths through the loop.Nested loops can be difÔ¨Åcult to optimize for tracing VMs. Ina na¬®ƒ±ve implementation, inner loops would become hot Ô¨Årst, andthe VM would start tracing there. When the inner loop exits, theVM would detect that a different branch was taken. The VM wouldtry to record a branch trace, and Ô¨Ånd that the trace reaches not theinner loop header, but the outer loop header. At this point, the VMcould continue tracing until it reaches the inner loop header again,thus tracing the outer loop inside a trace tree for the inner loop.But this requires tracing a copy of the outer loop for every side exitand type combination in the inner loop. In essence, this is a formof unintended tail duplication, which can easily overÔ¨Çow the codecache. Alternatively, the VM could simply stop tracing, and give upon ever tracing outer loops.We solve the nested loop problem by recordingnested tracetrees. Our system traces the inner loop exactly as the na¬®ƒ±ve version.The system stops extending the inner tree when it reaches an outerloop, but then it starts a new trace at the outer loop header. Whenthe outer loop reaches the inner loop header, the system tries to callthe trace tree for the inner loop. If the call succeeds, the VM recordsthe call to the inner tree as part of the outer trace and Ô¨Ånishesthe outer trace as normal. In this way, our system can trace anynumber of loops nested to any depth without causing excessive tailduplication.These techniques allow a VM to dynamically translate a pro-gram to nested, type-specialized trace trees. Because traces cancross function call boundaries, our techniques also achieve the ef-fects of inlining. Because traces have no internal control-Ô¨Çow joins,they can be optimized in linear time by a simple compiler (10).Thus, our tracing VM efÔ¨Åciently performs the same kind of op-timizations that would require interprocedural analysis in a staticoptimization setting. This makes tracing an attractive and effectivetool to type specialize even complex function call-rich code.We implemented these techniques for an existing JavaScript in-terpreter, SpiderMonkey.
