 have chrome extension with code addatched. How to add also link (in the same column Link  to html  document saved in indexedDB )


I can help you add a link to view the saved HTML document from IndexedDB. We'll need to modify the popup.js file to create a new function to retrieve and display the HTML content, and add another link in the Link column.


Modified popup.js with HTML viewer functionality
Click to open code

Modified background.js with HTML retrieval
Click to open code
These changes will:

Add a "View Saved" link next to the "Visit Original" link in the Link column
Add functionality to retrieve the saved HTML from IndexedDB
Display the saved HTML in a new tab/window when clicked
To implement this:

Update your popup.js with the content from the first artifact
Add the new functions to background.js from the second artifact
The interface will now show two links in the Link column:

"Visit Original" - opens the original webpage
"View Saved" - opens the saved HTML version from IndexedDB
I've also added error handling and made sure the links are properly formatted. The saved HTML will open in a new tab/window when clicked.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this implementation?

what will happen after clicking on saved page


When you click the "View Saved" link, the following occurs:

The viewSavedHTML() function sends a message to background.js requesting the HTML content for that key from IndexedDB
When retrieved, it opens a new browser tab/window
The saved HTML is written to this new window using document.write()
The saved webpage appears as it was when originally saved, but:
It will be static (no dynamic content/JavaScript)
Some resources (images, styles) may be missing if they were externally linked
It shows the exact HTML that was captured at save time
Want me to help improve how the saved page is displayed? We could enhance it by preserving styles and resources.
