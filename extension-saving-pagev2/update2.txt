Looking at the code more carefully, I notice a few potential improvements and issues to fix. Let's review the key parts:
Updated popup.js with improved handlingClick to open code
Key improvements made:

Switched to proper DOM manipulation instead of string concatenation:

Uses createElement() and appendChild() instead of string templates
Prevents HTML injection issues
Handles special characters properly


Improved URL extraction:

More robust handling of the space separator
Fallback if no space is found


Simplified button identification:

Uses array index for IDs instead of URL encoding
Eliminates encoding/decoding issues


Added better error handling:

More specific error messages
Validation in deleteKey function


Removed potentially problematic features:

No more innerHTML usage
No more template literals for HTML
No more onclick attributes



This version should handle all content properly, including:

Source code in the saved content
Special characters
Local file paths
Long text content

The table should now display cleanly with no broken columns or malformed HTML. Let me know if you need any clarification or run into any issues!
